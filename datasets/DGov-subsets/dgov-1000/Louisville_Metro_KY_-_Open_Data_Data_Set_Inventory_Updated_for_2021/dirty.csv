19,National Flood Hazard - Base Flood Elevations,"​
Base Flood Elevations for the 1% annual chance flood.
Flood hazard and supporting data are developed using specifications for horizontal control consistent with 1:12,000–scale mapping. If you plan to display maps from the National Flood Hazard Layer with other map data for official purposes, ensure that the other information meets FEMA’s standards for map accuracy.
The minimum horizontal positional accuracy for base map hydrographic and transportation features used with the NFHL is the NSSDA radial accuracy of 38 feet. USGS imagery and map services that meet this standard can be found by visiting the Knowledge Sharing Site (KSS) for Base Map Standards (420).
The NFHL data are from FEMA’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) databases. New data are added continually. The NFHL also contains map changes to FIRM data made by Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs).
The NFHL is stored in North American Datum of 1983, Geodetic Reference System 80 coordinate system, though many of the NFHL GIS web services support the Web Mercator Sphere projection commonly used in web mapping applications.",LOJIC,PW&A - Streets and Roads,Lojic,Lojic,,Public,Lojic,Continuous,,2020/08/27 03:59:59+00,,Citywide,Not applicable,Open Data Link
20,National Flood Hazard - Cross Sections,"​
Normally, any FIRM that has associated flood profiles has cross sections. The S_XS table contains information about cross section lines. These lines usually represent the locations of channel surveys performed for input into the hydraulic model used to calculate flood elevations. Sometimes cross sections are interpolated between surveyed cross sections using high accuracy elevation data. Depending on the zone designation (Zone AE, Zone A, etc.), these locations may be shown on Flood Profiles in the FIS report and can be used to cross reference the Flood Profiles to the planimetric depiction of the flood hazards. This information is used in the Floodway Data Tables in the FIS report, as well as on the FIRM panels.
Flood hazard and supporting data are developed using specifications for horizontal control consistent with 1:12,000–scale mapping. If you plan to display maps from the National Flood Hazard Layer with other map data for official purposes, ensure that the other information meets FEMA’s standards for map accuracy.

21,National Flood Hazard - FIRM Panels,"​
The S_FIRM_Pan table contains information about the FIRM panel area. A spatial file with location information also corresponds with this data table. The spatial entities representing FIRM panels are polygons. The polygon for the FIRM panel corresponds to the panel neatlines. Panel boundaries are generally derived from USGS DOQQ boundaries. As a result, the panels are generally rectangular. In situations where a portion of a panel lies outside the jurisdiction being mapped, the user must refer to the S_Pol_Ar table to determine the portion of the panel area where the FIRM Database shows the effective flood hazard data for the mapped jurisdiction. This information is needed for the FIRM Panel Index and the following tables in the FIS report: Listing of NFIP Jurisdictions, Levees, Incorporated Letters of Map Change, and Coastal Barrier Resources System Information. The spatial entities representing FIRM panels are polygons. The polygon for the FIRM panel corresponds to the panel neatlines. Panel boundaries are generally derived from USGS DOQQ boundaries. As a result, the panels are generally rectangular. FIRM panels must not overlap or have gaps within a study. In situations where a portion of a panel lies outside the jurisdiction being mapped, the user must refer to the S_Pol_Ar table to determine the portion of the panel area where the FIRM Database shows the effective flood hazard data for the mapped jurisdiction.

22,National Flood Hazard - Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA),"​
The LOMA point layer indicates coordinates for Letters of Map Amendment, which can affect flood zone determination without a map change. Please be aware that LOMA point layer is provided ‘as-is’ and that there are several issues that must be considered before using this information. The first is its positional accuracy. Where the point is shown on the map may, or may not, be totally accurate as there are a variety of methods that can be used to translate a mailing address into a geographic coordinate (geocoding). The second is the completeness of the dataset. This point layer only includes LOMAs that have a coordinate associated with them. There are a number of LOMAs that have been processed by FEMA which do not have any type of a coordinate associated with them and those LOMAs are not included within this data.
Flood hazard and supporting data are developed using specifications for horizontal control consistent with 1:12,000–scale mapping. If you plan to display maps from the National Flood Hazard Layer with other map data for official purposes, ensure that the other information meets FEMA’s standards for map accuracy.

Some of the entries represent encumbrances of intended expenditures which may or may not have occurred.  An hypothetical (not actual) example would be Metro submitting a bid for masks for $600k and we ended up losing the bid.  That estimated expenditure would be listed and “encumbered” on this list but ultimately removed since it was not successful.
Personnel costs are estimates based on daily time entries.  Final personnel costs will be pulled from actual payroll totals which are processed every two weeks.
