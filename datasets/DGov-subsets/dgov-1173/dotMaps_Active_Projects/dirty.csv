The new, permanent generator will function as a higher-capacity standby generator for both the Alki Wet Weather Treatment Station Facility and the 63rd Avenue Pump Station at 3535 Beach Drive SW, Seattle, WA. In the event of a utility outage, power from this standby generator located at the Alki Wet Weather Treatment Station Facility will run the 63rd Avenue Pump Station Facility pumps. The new, permanent generator will be located inside the existing generator and chlorine room at the Alki Wet Weather Treatment Station Facility.
The project will involve trenching within the public road right of way between the Alki Wet Weather Treatment Station Facility and the 63rd Avenue Pump Station in order to place a subterranean electrical duct bank at 5KV. The chosen route will extent from the Alki Wet Weather Treatment Station Facility down SW Wilton Court, onto 63rd Avenue SW, and finally along Beach Drive SW to the 63rd Avenue Pump Station. The 5KV power needs to be stepped down to 480V at the 63rd Avenue Pump Station in order to run the pumps, and a transformer is required to change voltage. Subsequently, additional above-ground project elements include a transformer box within a small portion of the public right of way immediately adjacent to the 63rd Avenue Pump Station, which is also located in public right of way. A subterranean transformer vault will be installed below the transformer box. A similar transformer and transformer vault will be installed at the Alki Wet Weather Treatment Station Facility, along with an above-ground generator fuel storage tank located near the generator room. Other project elements include electrical upgrades and new connections required between the ends of the linear electrical condui",Other Construction,Active,SUSIP0000045,SUSIP0000045,,,2161.82499219089,20995.9271152683
