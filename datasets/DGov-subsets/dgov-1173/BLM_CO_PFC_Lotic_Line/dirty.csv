General Comments – Livestock use throughout area appears to be pretty much season long. This situation has been noted for the past two to three years.  Suspect higher numbers for longer timeframe than authorized – or if not, current authorized use needs to be adjusted significantly.
",YES,"Heavy livestock use causal factor for above problems. Continuation of this level of livestock use would be expected to lead to further and more severe unrecoverable deterioration of this high priority system.

Currently if range improvements are restored to functional condition and grazing is modified/controlled to appropriate duration and intensity, this system has all components present to fully recover though down-cutting and lateral expression would be slowest

The stream channel is more straightened, at some section where incised channel sections are present, but the sinuosity, width/depth ratio, and gradient in some stream segments are in balance with the landscape setting. Lack of stream flow because of lost contact with ground water, riparian zone is not widening and reach to its potential and most sections floodplain is not inundated in frequent event. Downcutting channels in some sections are also observed preventing relatively frequent flood events from reaching the top of the channel and the historic floodplain is inaccessible and has become a terrace. These segments have recovered from past channel incision and created new floodplain. The upper most upstream section is changed from intermittent to ephemeral drainage with no riparian veg present. Comments: Biedell Creek has lack of overall riparian vegetation, some Carex sp., Juncus sp., willows, and cottonwoods are present but in very low amounts along the middle section of this reach. Both upper and lower sections appear to be slowing converting to an ephemeral system. Most grass and woody sp. consist of upland sp. Poa, Pinon and Juniper. And have encroached into the floodplain. Comments: in few sections of the creek, rocks, riparian veg, and large woody debris are present but not adequate to dissipate energy. In most segments, no riparian veg-cover present to withstand bank erosion and the channel is unstable both vertically and laterally. Sediment deposit is observed on channel bottom and the channel is widening in some places, due to some ephemeral tributaries have active headcut and bank erosion, adjacent roadway, and the excess sediment from channel bank erosion of Biedell Creek.

Comments: in few sections of the creek, rocks, riparian veg, and large woody debris are present but not adequate to dissipate energy.  In most segments, no riparian veg-cover present to withstand bank erosion and the channel is unstable both vertically and laterally.  Sediment deposit is observed on channel bottom and the channel is widening in some places, due to some ephemeral tributaries have active headcut and bank erosion, adjacent roadway, and the excess sediment from channel bank erosion of Biedell Creek.

It seems this stream is perennial stream in the past but now changing to intermittent stream. The stream channel is more straightened, at some section where incised channel sections are present, but the sinuosity, width/depth ratio, and gradient in most upstream section of the stream are in balance with the landscape setting. Lack of stream flow because of lost contact with ground water, riparian zone is not widening and reach to its potential and most sections floodplain is not inundated in frequent event. Downcutting channels in some sections also observed that prevent relatively frequent flood events from reaching the top of the channel and the historic floodplain is inaccessible and has become a terrace. These segments have recovered from past channel incision and created new floodplain. Comments: This system is converting to an intermittent stream channel. The riparian vegetation #6 &amp; #10 changes in age-class, composition and vigor occur along the entire reach. There are two active springs that are providing some flow. In these areas, vegetation shows diverse age-class, composition and vigor but as you move away from these areas the vegetation changes to a reduced amount of diverse age-class, composition and vigor. Sedge sp., willow and cottonwoods show sign of utilization by livestock and wildlife. Comments: Rocks, riparian veg, and large woody debris are present in most upstream section to adequately dissipate energy. However, in some sections these features are not present, to properly dissipate energy and the stream channel is unstable both vertically and laterally.

Frequent overbank events are evident from deposition of plant materials and thin layers of silt and clay deposition on the floodplain.  The sinuosity, width/depth ratio, and gradient in most sections of the stream are in balance with the landscape setting.  Riparian zone is widening in most places and the riparian vegetation on the streambanks provide opportunity to trap sediment and expand the riparian area inward by narrowing the channel.  Upland watershed is not contributing riparian degradation because presence of adequate riparian vegetation in most segment of La Garita Creek. Active and stable beaver dams are present. Comments: La Garita Creek is a good representation of a perennial stream in PFC, Diverse age class and composition for maintenance and recovery. Dense mat of Carex sp., Juncus sp., along with willows, alder and cottonwoods along stream banks. Riparian vegetation has reached potential extent. High flows in 2019, have caused in some small areas bank undercutting but appeared have stability due to the dense mat of vegetation.   Comments: in most sections of La Garita Creek, rocks, large woody debris, and adequate riparian veg are present to adequately dissipate energy.  Stream is in balance with the water and sediment being supplied by the watershed.  However, some sediment deposition is observed on stream bed due to some stream bank erosion.  Due high flows in 2019 some small areas are showing bank erosion, shearing, and sloughing creating lateral stream movement that is not associated with natural sinuosity, but deep-rooted riparian bank cover have allowed stability with some undercutting.

However, there’s upland encroachment of Juniper trees in some areas and some dying Alder where beaver dams present (possibly inundated with water throughout the year). 13-17: There is good woody material, vegetation, and rocks to dissipate energy during high flows. All point bars and islands all are vegetated. Streambanks are stable creating new floodplain, except in a few area where cattle ae crossing stream channel. Some erosional features and sediment deposition present. The sediment deposition is due to erosion from upland watershed. In a few small areas hummocks from cattle is present. Overall Remarks: Ford Creek is on an upward trend and has improved in condition since the road encroachment project was implemented. This project involved moving the road away from the stream channel to promote riparian vegetation expansion, natural sinuosity to occur as well as minimize sedimentation.
