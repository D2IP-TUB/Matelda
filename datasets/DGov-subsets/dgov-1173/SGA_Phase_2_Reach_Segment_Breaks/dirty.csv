It is vertically stable and many banks are exposed bedrock. The left bank is encroached upon by Route 14, and there are several houses between the road and the channel, posing a serious hazard during large floods. Right bank has a recently formed floodplain mid-segment, but the rest is semi-confined.

Revised valley walls for the main stem were derived from field observations and historic photographs of the White River valley after the 1927 flood. Cross-section was taken a widest part of the valley for this reach, so several measurements of the valley wall were taken that average to 595ft.

D-Model CEM was chosen because channel is bedrock controlled and can only adjust by aggrading sediment, widening, and shifting planform. It is possible that significant scour of sediments making up the banks and channel were eroded out during the flood of 1927, because of this significant change to channel form stage III of the CEM was chosen. The current floodplain is composed of very thin soil deposits on bedrock and probably formed post 1927 flood

The terrace beyond the right bank on the cross-section is most likely a glacial terrace in a timescale greater than the last 200 years. Based on the parent material (some alluvial from river and trib confluence to west, but predominantly glacio-fluvial high on the terrace), the terrace was likely formed when Glacial Lake Hitchcock occupied the Connecticut River basin and extended up into the White River valley. This terrace was only partially accessed during the 1927 flood - not as extensively as the adjacent terrace upstream in R05.",,,Plane Bed,D,Segment controlled by bedrock and vertically stable.

Channel flows across alluvial fan feature that is revealed by concentric topographic contours, and which is identified as an alluvial fan by surficial geologic mapping.  Valley width is reduced somewhat by Kansas Rd to the southwest and VT Rt 7 to the north, but not significantly enough to change the confinement ratio (Very Broad).  Two new residential homes are located along the LB corridor within 150 ft of active flood chutes; otherwise land use is dense, young-growth forest.  The present alignment of VT Route 7 was constructed between 1980 and 1986 based on review of historic aerial photographs.  Small straightening length and berm length are associated with VT Rt 7 bridge crossing at upstream end of segment.  Cross section was not measured since to encompass the full breadth of the multiple active channels would require a land survey with multiple setups.  Also, any one channel would contain only a portion of the overall flow through the segment, and not correspond to VT Regional Hydraulic Geometry curve data which are established for single-thread B and C channels.  Since, every single channel thread was not walked, the counts for bar types (5.1), migration features (5.2), steep riffles (5.3) and the erosion lengths (3.1) are underestimated for the segment.  Since the VHD represents flow in this segment as a single channel, and since FIT indexes features to this single thread the locations of noted features should be considered approximate.

The current x-sectional area is 281.0 sq ft, and the reference x-sectional area based on regional hydraulic curves would be somewhere around 155.7 sq. ft. A lower bankfull elevation that was only clear on one side of the stream (no clear feature on opposite bank)  would give a x-sectional area of 172.2 sq. ft, and the incision ratio would go to 1.8. The floodprone area would be significantly reduced as well, dropping entrenchment ratio to an F stream (ER ~1.2). Decided to stay with higher bankfull elevation, indicating the bankfull may be reflecting an essentially impounded area (over short durations, especially during ice jams) above the constriction at the base of the segment, and reflecting fact that stream does have some floodplain access at high flows. 
Gordon Kittredge, owner of property including partially breached mill dam at upstream end of segment,  reports frequent jams; ice damage evident on numerous trees along banks.  Winter 2007/08 had several midwinter thaws with ice jams frequent and these were likely the source of  sediments interpreted as some of the bankfull indicators.

Channel evolution, particularly widening (low levels of erosion), appears to be retarded by extensive riprapping.
Valley has been narrowed by road encroachment, but even with full natural valley width and reference channel width the valley would still be semi-confined.
Waits River Rd./Rte 25 forms a human elevated floodplain, and ag fields off LB behind the road were accounted as recently abandoned floodplain (within last 200 yrs). The elevation of these fields may have been altered by road construction (this is a state highway). 
A more recent round of incision may be indicated off the RB at a much lower elevation but has likely been impacted by road construction near a sand and gravel pit that appears to have been worked in that area subsequent to 1983 topo maps.This road may have led to a stream ford downstream, and/or may be a snow machine trail; a tractor with a bucket would have been sufficient to do the kind of levelling observed. This may also have been a historic flood chute; floodprone flows that might access this area would likely return to the stream a short distance downstream. High flows (major floods above floodprone (2x TW) height) might be of concern in terms of accessing the gravel pit, which has very steep sand banks at the back edge; better surveying would be required to determine the likelihood of this possibility.

Old Mill Rd in RB corridor and Pleasant St in LB corridor are slightly elevated above the surrounding floodplain, and therefore resulted in a slight human-caused change in valley width (St 1.5) - enough to change the valley type (from Very Broad to Narrow), but not sufficient to change the confinement type (unconfined).  Floodplain along both sides of the channel is developed with residential buildings (village of East Arlington).  Development is historic dating back to the mid- to late-1700s (Child, 1880) and once included planing mill, black smith shop, and Judson & Billings factory (Walling, 1856; Beers, 1869).  Channel margins have likely been graded and reworked during historical development and during recovery from past flood events.  Streambanks have been heavily armored with rip-rap.  Channel is partly incised below the floodplain (IRraf = 1.4).  Berms are present along both banks (with an occasional break along the RB berm) - which has increased the degree of channel entrenchment (IRhef = 2.0, ER = 1.47) to cause a stream type departure (C to F).  Vertical concrete wall at the downstream end of the segment protects Old Mill Rd and encroaches on the channel.  Three stormwater pipes were observed penetrating the wall and directing drainage to the channel.  Concrete wall has significant cracking/ spalling and is scoured near the interface with the channel bed.    East Arlington Rd bridge crosses the channel at the downstream end of the segment; bridge has a bankfull-constricting span, with minor aggradation noted at the inlet.

Two channel-spanning exposures of bedrock (""waterfall"") were observed in the segment.  Upstream-most exposure is actually the base of the grist mill falls; technically, this waterfall would be grouped with the upstream segment of bedrock channel; however, it was indexed within this segment T2S1S1.01-C due to a slightly  mis-located Phase 1 reach break.  Old Mill Rd in RB corridor and Pleasant St in LB corridor are slightly elevated above the surrounding floodplain, and therefore resulted in a slight human-caused change in valley width (St 1.5) - enough to change the valley type (from Very Broad to Broad), but not sufficient to change the confinement type (unconfined).  Floodplain along both sides of the channel is developed with residential, municipal, and commercial buildings (village of East Arlington).  Development is historic dating back to the mid- to late-1700s (Child, 1880) and once included the Judson & Billings factory (Beers, 1869).  Channel margins have likely been graded and reworked during historical development and during recovery from past flood events.

Rate of channel evolution likely moderated at this point in time by decent buffers and coarse substrates.
Conceivable this area may represent an E to C stream type departure as part of D model channel evolution (45 ft ph2 measured channel is significantly narrower than 66 ft predicted by reference hydraulic curves, and Narrow valley confinement in step 1.5 is based on human change of valley width in this segment in combination with the reference channel width). Bank erosion tempered by presence of good buffers, but field notes specifically noted perception of a switch to reference C stream type (from E type in next segment downstream), and soil maps reinforce a change from alluvial to glacio-fluvial (gravelly outwash) parent materials in this area.
Stage IV channel evolution indicated by some rebuilding of floodplain at a lower elevation.

""Alluvial fan"" was selected to capture the significant slope change (from approx 7% to less than 2%) that occurs in this segment.  Large boulder/cobble/earthen berms along both LB and RB at the transition point from the bedrock gorge (reach M18) out into the valley in order to protect several residential lots at this location.  1938 flood resulted in a major avulsion that cut off the broad meander that comprises this segment; flood flows eroded residential lots (Jennings, 2002).  Straightening with windrowing is inferred associated with this post-flood response.  States Prison Hollow Rd passes within the LB corridor but at an elevation well above the FPW on the left valley wall.  alignment of the States Prison Hollow Road is relatively new – occurring post-1974 and pre-1995 based on a review of historic aerial photographs.  Previously the road crossed the Lewis Creek near the upstream end of the reach and followed the current alignment of States Prison Hollow Road Extension.  The old bridge abutment for this previous alignment has a measured span of approximately 45 feet.  States Prison Hollow Ext road crosses channel and encroaches upon the RB floodplain both upstream and downstream of the bridge.  Reduction in valley width changes the valley confinement categorization  from Very Broad (reference) to Broad (modified), but is not substantial enough to change the general confinement status (Unconfined).  Historic straightening inferred along right bank hay field; subtle berm also along RB adjacent to the hay field (downstream of bridge crossing).  This RB berm is only slightly higher than the floodplain and does not substantially reduce floodplain connection.   Despite a 11.6 W/D ratio measured at the cross section site, the segment was typed as a C stream considering the +/- 2 units for W/D ratio allowable under protocols (Table 2.3).  This cross section is at the downstream end of the segment where the Creek is transitioning into an E stream type.  Further upstream in the segment, visual observations suggest a slightly higher W/D ratio (> 12).  Low W/D ratio at the cross section may also be due to cohesive soils, and past inferred straightening with berm encroachment.",High,Fair,Unconfined,F,Minor widening and planform adjustment in response to inferred historic channelization & incision.

Historic straightening is inferred at the downstream end of the segment adjacent to the right-bank agricultural field (straightening is also apparent in downstream Segment A).  Incision appears to be historic, as there are no current signs of active incision and erosional scour of the banks is negligible.  Incision ratio (2.6) indicates a stream type departure (C to F).

It is recommened to determine the meander width ratio and the wavelength ratio to help assess the stability of the reach. This was not done as part of Phase 1.

2015 ASSESSMENT RESULTS:  This segment was impacted by a channel avulsion that occurred within this segment between 2011 and 2015.

A flood chute from Ace Brook enters the north branch. At top of south branch, there is a major change in slope, which is a result of sediment dropping out from upstream.  The sediment plug was caused by debris in the channel holding back sediment.  This feature was indexed as a steep riffle to indicate it was formed from depositional processes and not downcutting of the channel. However, if the debris lets loose, the held back sediment will be transported downstream as the feature will then act as a head cut. Alluvial fan indexed in this segment due to abrupt change in slope.  Does not have typical fan shaped wedge.

Valley width measured from valley wall to valley wall and not from valley wall to center of drainage line between Ace Brook and Unnamed trib 3.

It is recommened to determine the meander width ratio and the wavelength ratio to help assess the stability of the reach. This was not done as part of Phase 1.

Pebble count was done in North Branch. Did not do a pebble count in South Branch . It is recommended that a pebble count be done in South Branch in future assessments to capture the smaller substrate size in this channel.          

2015 ASSESSMENT NOTES:  A channel avulsion occurred on Ace Brook R45S3.1S1.01-C between 2011 and 2015, which caused all flow to abandon the Ace Brook channel and flow into the tributary toward the downstream end of R45S3.02-C. Two cross sections were measured in this segment in 2011 and repeated in 2015. The lower of the two cross sections captured flow from both brooks in 2015. This cross section was noted as being the less representative of the two cross sections in 2011. The upper cross section changed very little between 2011 and 2015. The upper portion of the segment is very stable, with two bedrock grade controls deterring channel adjustment. The addition of the flow from Ace Brook to the lower portion of the segment has resulted in channel enlargement and associated adjustments. This section of the brook has incised and widened since it was last measured in 2011. In 2015, the geomorphic and habitat condition of R45S3.02-C were both good. Habitat features were similar between the two years. The brook is experiencing additional adjustments at the downstream end of the segment, but remains stable above.",,,Unconfined,F,"Channel not incised. There are two channels in this segment that split at the top and are two step-pool channels. There is an island in between the two channels.

Low-bank heights along the channel were generally less than in upstream Segment C, ranging from approximately 1.2 to 1.6 times the thalweg height.  Incision appeared historic in nature.  Near the downstream end of the segment was a short section of moderately-steep, narrowly-confined bedrock gorge.  This section of B2-step/pool channel underlain by bedrock was indexed as a vertical grade control, but was not segmented due to its short overall length (less than 75 feet).  Between the bedrock outcroppings was a short, linear section of channel confined between a left-bank terrace with a thalweg height of approximately 7 feet and a right-bank terrace approx 15 feet above the thalweg.  The channel had access to a narrow floodplain approximately 20 to 30 feet wide between these two terraces.  A cross section measured here (XS-1) indicated an incision ratio of 1.3 and an entrenchment ratio of 1.8.  This gravel-dominated Bc-riffle/pool channel was not characteristic of the segment as a whole, but was not segmented due to its very short length. The linear nature of the channel and its unusual setting suggested historic channel modifications - possibly associated with the history of iron ore mining in the region.

There is a large grade control in reach M02 that extends down into the top of M01-J (this grade control was indexed in M02).  Upon further analysis, the elevation of the RAF in the cross section done in M01-F has been changed.  That segment now has an incision ratio of 1.6.  The cross section is not representative for M01-H; however, original channel dimensions (elevation of RAF) measure in M01-F remain entered for Step 2 because they are the most representative for this segment.

Peacham Barnet Road has likely narrowed valley width somewhat  near intersection with S. Main Street in South Peacham, though close consideration in the field suggested that a flood would run down the road and to the outside of it in most cases, and the road may present a confinement primarily in lower-level floods. Once the stream passes through the culvert under the Peacham-Groton Rd in South Peacham, however, the stream is more confined for a brief stretch in the vicinity of Mill Trace before having access to floodplain again in the lower portion of the segment; conceivable this stretch should have been segmented out.

The mid-section near Mill Trace does not appear to be a Human Elevated Floodplain  – it is likely  terraces of suspected glacial origin, and the structures placed on them occurred during historic times on an older geologic feature. No incision was observed, but the stream certainly has less access to floodplain in this area, and widening and planform change are the dominant adjustment processes; hence the stage FIII CEM selected for the reach, despite an Incision Ratio of 1.00.

Significant recent land use changes (not apparent on '98 orthos) in next reach upstream (T1.07) but  beaver-controlled area (T1.06C) in between.

Current LVW is a high terrace (11 ft above thalweg) that appears likely to be of glacial origin; was originally accounted as LTER but reassessed as current LVW_ soils are glacial or dense till but fine to very fine sandy loam, well vegetated. RAF in step 2 is blank because of difficulty in determining if this feature is of glacial origin, or represents historic (i.e., post-glacial) incision.

Appears that glacial legacy in this area may be similar to dynamics noted for reaches T1.03 and 1.04, with glacial ponding that left massive incision when sediment dams that created these impoundments let loose; former low gradient valley would have been a Broad valley on the higher terrace rather than the current Narrow valley.

Riffle-pool subdominant bedform due to weak riffle formation, likely transitory.
Walling 1858 map indicates mill pond at downstream end of segment.

This segment was classified an F type stream by reference, primarily due to the significant bedrock presence in both bed and banks: few indications of incision or widening were observed. That said, it is quite conceivable (and actually likely) that indicators were simply not discernible given the amount of bedrock and boulders present, as well as the possibility that the significant historic encroachments along the reach (East Corinth village essentially surrounds this reach) have further obscured any indicators. 

In essence, this segment likely represents: 
a) a B type stream that, due to historic impacts, has experienced significant  incision and/or widening and undergone a stream type departure to an F type stream; or
b) an F type stream by reference, where mills were located because of the bedrock that was exposed at its current level already.
Due to the amount of bedrock and boulders present (D50 substrate is boulder) the sensitivity of the stream under either of these scenarios is Low.

According to a mill dam owner upstream in the next segment, Tabor Branch (of which this segment is a part) historically had six mills operating concurrently at one point, with flows allocated through the course of the day to power the mills successively. Pulse flows through this narrow valley could quite conceivably have led to deep historic incision (making channel more entrenched) or severe widening (leading to a situation where the ratio of  floodprone width to channel width approached 1.0 as the channel widened). The entrenchment ratio noted for this segment was 1.2, within the  ±0.2 variation in the Rosgen classification system that would mark the transition from a B type (ER 1.4 - 2.2) to an F type (ER<1.4) stream.",High,Good,Plane Bed,D,"Bedrock controlled; primarily historic planform change (mill races and foundations) but some abutments and riprap still present; minor aggradation appears transitory, widening limited by bedrock, abutments, and coarse substrate",Good,Low,2009/09/08 00:00:00+00,,0,0,0,32767,2143354879,,,,None,,None,1,,1,Riffle-Pool,,,,,,,,,,734

2015 ASSESSMENT NOTES:  During the 2015 Phase 2 assessment, BCE scientists observed several new debris jams within R48-C. These debris jams are causing more aggradation and planform adjustment than was previously observed, though both processes are still minor. Additionally, in 2015 there was a localized headcut caused by a debris jam at the upstream end of the segment. In 2011, there were no headcuts observed in R48-C. Overall, R48-C was still a very stable segment in 2015 and thus was placed in good geomorphic condition.

In one location mid-segment, where the height of the road is approximately 3.5 times the bankfull depth, presence of a short berm (between the road and the channel) and left-bank armoring suggests that the river may have avulsed in a past flood to wash out a section of the Patch Brook Road and temporarily occupy a small floodplain on the far side of the road.  Encroachment by the road has resulted in human-modication of the valley width, such that the floodplain is now generally less than two channel widths (i.e., Narrowly-Confined).   The natural valley width, prior to the road, was probably not much wider (between 1.5 to 2.5 times the channel width, or Narrowly-Confined to Semi-Confined valley type).  No significant change in the reference stream type (Ba-S/P) is inferred as a result of the road encroachment. 21 cross culverts were indexed, most often 16 or 18 inches in diameter, but a few of 12- to 14-inch diameter and a few 2 feet in diameter.   Often fine sand and gravels obstructed culvert inlets and culvert outlets were unstable (no headers).  Road sediment was observed directly entering the channel at the outlet of several culverts.  A few additional locations of direct sediment runoff by overland flow were indexed along the reach. Remnants of a possible instream dam were noted near the upstream end of the reach in the vicinity of historic mills depicted on the Beers Atlas (1869).  This dam appears to have been breached long ago (perhaps in the 1927 flood or prior events). Upstream flow regulation is Lake Ninevah dam; outlet channel for this lake joins Patch Brook just above the upstream end of the reach.

Valley walls marked by Lime Kiln Road to the west and North Street to the east are comprised of glacial till sediments (USDA) with shallow bedrock (Calkin, 1965).  Residential and agricultural buildings are sparse and concentrated along the roads at the valley edges.  Crop fields (corn) are abundant in the left corridor.  Hay and some crop fields are extensive in the right corridor.  One small timber bridge spans the channel near the middle of the segment, coincident with an equipment ford providing access to the fields.  Two other equipment fords were observed within the segment.  The timber footbridge was a minor structure comprised of a log with wooden hand rail – probably functions as LWD or a DJ during high flows, without significant constriction of the channel.  For this reason, a Bridge & Culvert Assessment was not completed.  One beaver dam was observed near the downstream end of the segment, impounding a channel length of approximately 800 feet.  Several field ditches convey field drainage (from corn fields) directly to the channel.  Also, three points of concentrated overland flow from field edges to the channel were observed.  Similar planform on 1962 and 1942 aerial photographs.  One pre-1995 neck cutoff.  Two short sections of possible straightening (apparently pre-1942) were indexed within the segment, where a linear planform was present for a distance greater than 20 times the channel width in close proximity to cultivated fields.  Straightening has not been independently confirmed (through historic documentation).  Despite possible historic straightening, these sections are not incised below the floodplain.  It is possible that cohesive sediments in the channel boundaries and/or very low valley gradients may have moderated the potential for vertical (and lateral) channel adjustments in response to inferred straightening.

Valley walls are high terraces of till and glaciolacustrine sediments with heights far exceeding 3 times the thalweg depth of the channel.  Where valley confinement relaxes, flood chutes or occasional bifurcated sections of the channel have developed.  Frequent entrainment of large woody debris and debris jams have contributed to localized bank erosion and lateral adjustments.  Near the downstream end of the segment, the channel has impinged upon the valley wall (right-bank) exposing till deposits and unconsolidated, possible glaciofluvial sediments.   A steep riffle upstream from this mass failure appears aggradational, related to the recent debris jam / mass failure event – perhaps occurring during the 2004 flood. Negligible incision is apparent; the channel has access to the surrounding (although quite narrow) floodplain.   Beers Atlas (1871) shows historic impoundment upstream in reach M14.  Also referenced in historic documents of Earl Bessette (2007).  Beers Atlas also shows a historic road crossing the channel. No bridge remains, but remnants of historic bridge abutments are evident collapsed in the channel.  Upper end of the segment has more of a E dune-ripple appearance, transitional from the upstream reach (M14).  Riffle / pool bedform is weak.  A stormwater input from the road has developed into a small gully that joins the right bank near the mid-point of the segment.  Also, drain tile outlets directed from the hay field across Plank Road discharge to the high valley wall along the right bank.

Residential development is present along the RB between North St and Plank Rd (although up on the valley wall), and along LB (though outside of the river corridor).  Segment was historically straightened and bermed (Bessette, 2009, p.69).   Review of aerial photographs indicates channel was straightened between 1942 and 1974.  The two culvert crossings of North Street and Plank Road are bankfull constrictors.  Scour pools have developed below each culvert, and aggradation is evident above the Plank Road culvert. A subreach of C-riffle/pool reference stream type is inferred from the valley setting and from the planform of the pre-straightened channel evident on the 1942 aerial photograph.  Given the channelization, dredging and berming of the channel, this segment has undergone a moderate departure to a C4-plane bed channel with moderate incision below the right-bank floodplain.  Entrenchment of the channel is enhanced by presence of the LB berm at a thalweg height of 7.8 ft.  D50 is a visual estimate, since cross section measured in March of 2011, and ice-cold temperatures precluded pebble count.
