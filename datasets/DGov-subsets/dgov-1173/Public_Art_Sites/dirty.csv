Themes here include the initial divisions caused by canal, freeway, boulevard and light rail; water links past and future and strong neighborhood pride despite economic and social divisions.
Bourdett's Links and the Circuitous Path illustrate the formation of community through a long and circuitous chain of events.  Nearly divided but still connected, the links and serpentine shapes combine traditional forms with patterns addressing the flow of change.
Above the canopy line, Corson's v use the architectural vernacular of the perforated louvers, under which are located an arrangement of colored neon tubes.  The concept is that the coded language used extensively in the pioneer days and the early railroad system.
Shaw's work relates directly to the Tempe canal history and auto culture.  Blue glass/water canal pavers stripe across the platform while a dark line of pavers suggests the freeway cutting across the area simultaneously obstructing and providing access.

The gates are lit internally by fluorescent lighting powered by solar panels custom sized to fit to the top of the gate. The gates have custom cast aluminum panels with one inch-thick chucks of colored glass imbedded into them. When open, the light shines through and glistens off the polished surface of the faceted aluminum. When closed, the zigzag crack glows with color. Conceptually the gates are like a geode, rough and rustic on the outside, but when broken open, a crystalline surface is revealed.

""They're not ordinary birds,"" Nelson says. ""Part animal and part human, part nature and part culture, silent instead of noisy, defying the desert heat, oblivious to the clatter of an industrial neighborhood."" Nelson believes that, in public art, even a small surprise can leave a big and lasting impression on the memory of passersby. ","John Randall Nelson lives and works in Tempe, and received his Master of Fine Arts from Arizona State University. As an illustrator, painter and sculptor Nelson has seen his mixed media illustrations appear frequently in publications like The New York Times and Rolling Stone. His paintings and sculptures have been featured in numerous solo and group shows including Gallery Materia in Scottsdale, the Carter Center at Emory University and the Tamarind Institute in Albuquerque, N.M.",,https://www.tempe.gov/publicart,https://gis.tempe.gov/publicart/Nelson_Flock%20of%20Black%20Birds.jpg,John Nelson,2001,2001,,Wells Fargo & Co.,,

The sculpture echoes the shape of a feather and the shape of a leaf, two of the elements which contribute to the special quality of a neighborhood characterized by old tree growth that provides a haven to numerous bird species. The 17.5' tall perforated metal sculpture is lit from within and semi-transparent, creating a lighted entryway at night. As the Arizona light shifts in the sky, filtering through the perforated metal, moire patterns are created on the sculpture's surface, giving it a sense of motion. The sculptural marker is supported by a stone base, further emphasizing the importance of the natural environment to the daily lives of its residents.","Born in Hartford, Connecticut, and raised in Israel, Barbara Grygutis received an MFA from the University of Arizona.

Here, abstract representations of vials, syringes etc. deliver their contents to the human form where they are circulated throughout the body. ","Shortly after earning his Bachelor of Fine Arts in both Graphic Design and Photography from the University of Iowa, Daniel Moore moved to Phoenix, AZ., where he worked full time as a graphic designer for a variety of corporate entities. Inspired by the works of Ansel Adams, in addition to his day job, he pursued his love of photography by photographing the natural world while hiking, backpacking and mountain biking throughout Arizona. Over the years, Moore has had exhibitions of his photographs in many local galleries. At his last position, his skill set expanded to 3-Dimensional pieces, which is where he taught himself to weld and found a new respect for and appreciation for steel. Through his work as an artist, Moore creates spaces that enhance the built environment, invites personal interaction, and engages the public through his works of art by identifying themes meaningful to each specific site and community.","This project was funded by the individual developer, West Pharmaceutical Services, as a requirement of Tempe's Art in Private Development Ordinance.",,https://www.tempe.gov/publicart,https://gis.tempe.gov/publicart/Moore_Infusion.jpg,Daniel Moore,2021,2021,,West Pharmaceutical Services,,

The whimsical cartoon character that soars across the sky is reminiscent of some of Jay's early art influences from comic books. Using rich colors and playful natural landscapes, Jay Valentin hopes to capture the essence of the evening skies. ","Jay Valentin grew up in Arizona, drawing free-hand comic book and movie characters. In college he only took art classes, soon finding his mentor, a Hollywood movie poster artist from the 80's, inspiring Jay to be a painter full time. Shortly after, Jay fell in love with the street art movement which embraced bright colors and pop culture references. This inspired the development of his own unique style, injecting Russian-Impressionism and fine art techniques into his own Pop Art Impressionism. Jay became a hit on social media, making huge waves on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and more. His success paved a clear path to the art world. Jay continues to inspire through his art with his unique vibrancy and visual appeal.","The project was funded through the City of Tempe Municipal Arts Fund, and Downtown Tempe Authority.",,https://www.tempe.gov/publicart,https://gis.tempe.gov/publicart/Valentin_Untitled.jpg,Jay Valentin,2022,2022,,,,
