PERIOD OF RECORD:  Discharge record for irrigation season only was published from June 1924 to October 1939 and the associated GH record was published from April 1945 to December 1946.   Discharge for the full year began Jan 1940 to present and full year stage record began April 1947 through 2011.  No peak discharge record was computed. 

HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS:  This station represents the discharge flow of Sacramento Slough to the Sacramento River.   Low flow conditions represent the combined flows of Sutter Bypass and Reclamation District 1500.  Reclamation District 1500 pumping plant located one mile upstream can contribute substantial amount of flow to the slough.  The Sacramento Slough gage is subjected to backwater conditions from the Sacramento and/or Feather River.  The discharge is calculated using the Slope/Area method from the hydraulic gradient between this gage and the upstream gage A02927, Sutter Bypass at R.D. 1500 located one mile upstream.  The hydraulic head between the two gages is often distorted by the R.D. 1500 pumping plant discharges near the upstream gage.  Frequent discharge measurements are required to adjust the ratings due to the backwater and the effects of the pumping plant.

When stage exceeds 28.00 ft at the Sacramento Slough gage, the slough is considered submerged or flooded.  No flow is calculated for flooded conditions.

Historically, the area within the basin was subject to periodic flooding from the Sacramento River. Flows in the basin generally discharges southeast to the river through a series of sloughs ending at Knights Landing above Fremont Weir. Agricultural land reclamation begun during the 1850's eventually drained much of the wetland area.  The Colusa Drain, a levied channel completed in the 1930's, intercepts all drainage on the west side of the Sacramento River between Colusa and Knights Landing, where the drain releases flows to the Sacramento River. Levees along the west bank of the Sacramento River block flooding from the Sacramento River.  Inflow into the basin comes from approximately 11 streams. Additionally, extremely high flows, greater than 300,000 cfs in the Sacramento River at Ord Ferry, would result in flows entering the Colusa Drain at that location. The Knights Landing Ridge Cut, on the southern end of the Colusa Drain, provides an outlet for floodflows (up to 20,000 cfs) to the Yolo Bypass when the outfall gates to the Sacramento River are closed. Flows to the Yolo Bypass through the Knights Landing Ridge Cut are limited to around 16,000 to 17,000 cfs when the Yolo Bypass is full.  Flows from the Colusa Drain enter the Sacramento River via outfall gates at Knights Landing when the river is low.
STATION LOCATION:  Gage house is located on the right bank of the Colusa Basin Drain by the Outfall Gates.
PERIOD OF RECORD:  For irrigation season only, flow records were published from 5/1924 to 10/1939.  Full annual mean discharge and stage is available from 1/1940 to 9/30/1975 (printed form) and 10/1/1975 to present (in digital form).  No record for WY 2005 due to lack of funds.  GH records available for 1957 - 1971 (printed form), 1976 - 2004, 2006 - 7/11/2013, 4/1/2015 to present (digital form).
HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS: Colusa Basin Drain is the major drain for the west side of the Sac Valley from Willows to Knights Landing, tributaries include Willow Creek, Walker Creek( Glenn County), Salt Creek, Luriline Creek (Colusa County) and other small  tributaries that drain from the west side of Sac River. Low flows are made up of mostly agriculture irrigation drain water during the growing season.  The control structure consists of 10 gates that control the Colusa Basin Drain.   Automatic controlled screw gates on the upstream side control discharge into Sacramento River.  Flap gates on the downstream side prevent Sac River from flowing into Colusa Basin Drain during high stage periods. 
Colusa Basin Drainage is controlled by 10 outfall gates, Gate 1 & 10 are 42"", gates 2 through 8 are 66"".  Flow calculations are based on flow conditions caused by the gate and flap gate settings of each gate relative to the head difference of the stage of this gage on Colusa Basin Drain (upstream of the gates) and that of the Sacramento River @ Knights Landing gage (downstream of the gates).  Gate invert is 18.12' USED based on informal survey in 10/12/2010.  (Invert was 18.25' in 1960)

There has been recent evidence that the gages may still be changing vertically.  The document, 2017 GPS Survey of the Sacramento Valley Subsidence Network published by DWR in 2018 reported that the elevation of BM #F859R have changed by -0.913 feet between the period of 2008 and 2017.

PERIOD OF RECORD: This is a stage only station with record beginning 10/1/2010.
HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS: Sutter Bypass is the downstream drainage of Butte Basin which is the northernmost of the natural overflow basins flanking the Sacramento River. Located east of the Sacramento River, it extends from northwest of Chico to the mouth of Butte Slough, north of Meridian. Its eastern boundary is an indefinite line along the gently sloping lands rising from the trough of the basin toward the Sierra Nevada foothills. The Glenn and Colusa County line divides Butte Basin into an upper basin and a lower basin. Overflow from Sacramento River at Moulton, Colusa and Tisdale weir can contribute to flows at higher stages. Sutter Bypass has an east and west low flow channel near the levee toes with overflow spreading to entire Bypass until contained by its levees.  Sutter Bypass flows terminate into Sacramento River upstream of Verona via Sac Slough during low flows, and into Sac River and Feather River at various locations during higher flows with the channel contained by Feather River left bank levee.
