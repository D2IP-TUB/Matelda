I read about half way through the comments before losing the will to live, and didn't see anyone claiming anything like ""Python delinks"". (I also searched for the bizarre word ""delink""; it isn't there.)<p>Then he links to Van Lindberg's lightning talk, where he does not by any possible stretch of the imagination say or imply or suggest or support anything even slightly like ""Python delinks"". He hardly gets as far as <i>mentioning</i> Python in his five minutes. I have no idea how anyone's belief that ""Python delinks"", whatever the hell that's supposed to mean, could be ""reinforced"" by anything he said.<p>I also asked Google about <<<python delink>>> and it didn't turn up anything remotely like what Zed appears to be talking about.<p>It's hard to be sure, though, because Zed never actually says what this weird belief is that he's commenting on. ""Python delinks"", ""the GPL doesn't apply to Python"" -- I'm pretty sure no one with a brain has said either of those crazy things, so what <i>is</i> this belief that he's caricaturing and disagreeing with? Zed never says.<p>(He does go on to make a positive claim about what the GPL allegedly means for Python software, namely that if you write something that can optionally use something GPLed to provide an extra feature it wouldn't otherwise have, then you have to release it under the GPL. I think that's debatable, but in any case disagreeing with it is not at all the same thing as saying that ""the GPL doesn't apply to Python"" or that ""Python delinks"".)",1274630015

The site sells KSOs for $85, and that's what I got mine for.  Because I've had such ridiculously good experiences there, I got mine from Run Away Shoes [1] near my house (your experience may vary), where you can try them on to check size / fit / whatnot.  Highly recommended you do that first.<p>($125 is for the kangaroo-leather super-deluxe model, which I'd imagine would be WAY too warm for any time but the winter.  Your toes don't get cold/pain/numb like in shoes, there's more blood-flow due to their being <i>used</i>.  Just cold.  At least, in my 30-degree-morning-walks-to-school (1 mile), and if I jogged they positively warmed up.)<p>First time I went running in them, I hadn't run more than a mile, intermittently, in over a year; I got lost, and ran 3.5 miles.  Felt great.  Land on the balls of your feet to take the landing-shock, keep your weight forward, slow down slightly, and take smaller strides; it'll feel right when you do it right.  And <i>be nice to your feet</i>, they take a long time to heal.  Looking at some barefoot running videos and deconstructing the strides helps a lot.<p>Speaking of healing, my forever-weak-and-puffy arches have been better from about the second week.  My calves had no problem, but I jump around a lot; the balls of my feet got sore after ~hour or so walking around on concrete / tile, however.  That cleared up after a couple weeks, and now I'm good all day.<p>As to washing them, my feet apparently sweat a lot.  Hopefully that'll change in time, but in the meantime I wear them daily / everywhere: they don't air-dry in a day.  If you force air into them (we've got an air purifier, and just lay them on top), they'll dry in an hour or two, but non-moving air won't dry them quickly.  * shrug <i></i> * maybe if you hung them outside?<p>[1] : <a href=""http://www.runawayshoes.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.runawayshoes.net/</a><p>edit: oh yeah, another surprising bonus: your balance improves <i>tremendously</i>, especially as your toes strengthen.

Not: at what price could I sell 100% of the asset in the market right now?<p>An actual cash purchaser is always giving up a current cash flow because they expect a larger future cash flow.<p>In your example, 2 and 3 can also be viewed based on cash flows. If you plan to build the same thing, buying it instead eliminates the negative cash flow of building it. Comparable transactions are based on how others valued comparable cash flows.<p>Economically, it's always about the cash flow.

1372444,comment,1371244,1372111,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, no Al Qaeda leader is going to deploy a single nuclear weapon on the US or other nuclear power without full and implicit knowledge that our nations opposition to this war will flip 100%.<p>I'm sorry, the reaction after 9/11 lead to a full blown invasion of two countries (regardless of any other motives behind the actions, it was the public opinion that allowed it to happen) and that was just a couple of buildings disappearing. If a nuke had been deployed in New York, the populace would only have been happy to let the government turn Afghanistan or Iraq into a few million square miles of radioactive desert glass.<p>The terrorist organizations themselves are acting logically by using illogical agents. The men who killed themselves on 9/11 weren't logical, but their actions were considering the masterminds behind the scheme. Right now if Al Qaeda got a nuclear weapon, they're still at a losing ratio of >1000:1. I'm sorry, but the reason the USSR went nuts building nukes was because the US already had hundreds developed by the time the USSR only had a dozen and it wasn't MAD logic it was suicide logic. Any deployment of nukes in the early stages of the cold war would have wiped them out. Similarly, a terrorist organization is only ever going to get its hands on a handful of nukes, it'll never have the 1000's required to destroy western civilization, so the deployment of a nuke only guarantees the destruction of their own.<p>I'm sorry, but Islamic Terrorism really doesn't instill fear if every Muslim just bit the atomic dust. I'd hate to see a world where we wiped out countless countries mainly because of religious association, but I really don't see anything else happening if a terrorist organization detonated a nuke in NYC or any other city.",1274629500

It's kinda old-school, but in no way out of date.).<p>Almost the entire book is about how luxury goods are NOT consumed by rich people, but by semi-struggling middle class people. (BMW's, Rolex, premium liquor, etc.) (Or at least people who have to go in to debt to consume these things.)<p>(It's also about how rich people DO live, choose to buy stuff, negotiate, etc.)<p>Everybody in this thread who's saying, ""duh, cars aren't supposed to be an investment,"" are technically right.  And everybody should indulge in things that really make them happy. If cars are your thing, go on, do your thing. It's all good.<p>But in the Millionaire Next Door, it goes over how cars are an especially precarious purchase for most people, as they just really eat up a lot of money over time.  For most people, even non-luxury car purchases require a loan.<p>Cars might be more dangerous for us than say Rolexes, because most of us think ""well either way I have to have a car, might as well get a _____.""<p>Anyway, maybe this article wasn't the most persuasive case, but it is true. Most rich people don't have fancy cars, or probably fancy anything.<p>(In the Millionaire Next Door, it says we get confused by this because there are a famous outliers who show off their wealth, so we incorrectly associate wealth with luxury, when they're rarely related.)",1274629498

Here's why I previously bought a new car (the high-end trim level Matrix, not luxury though):<p>I wanted a low mileage car because I had owned several high-mileage, but reliable, used cars, and calculated that I spent at least $200/mo over the year on routine repairs and maintenance.<p>A low-mileage (sub-30K) late year model, otherwise identical used car cost only $2,500 less than the new car.<p>The interest rate on a no-downpayment loan for the new car was 0% for 12 mos and 3.9% after. The interest rate on the no-downpayment loan on the used car was 13% from the start.<p>On the new car, I wouldn't have to pay for the first major service for about 18 months. On the used car, it was coming up in a matter of months. (The 30k). Not to mention it would soon need new tires, brake pads/rotor turning, and it was the half-life for the struts and major transmission services, too. (That's $1000 right there.)<p>You have no idea how the used car was treated in the breakin period and early oil changes, etc, and by only 30K miles, the damage won't have shown itself the way it will have by 80K miles. So when buying a low-mileage used car, sometimes you're actually making a greater gamble.<p>As you can see, all the logical points added up to buying the new car. It would actually cost less because of the financing and repair bills I would be less likely to pay during ownership.<p>Additionally, I was able to buy it right away, without having to hunt around, because the first few used ones I found with the trim level I wanted were safety cone yellow. Ugh.<p>Moral: BUYING USED ISN'T ALWAYS A SMARTER DEAL.<p>I love splurging on things, but not when the splurge comes back to haunt me month after month. ;)<p>EDIT: I agree with you about the luxury car, period, and also I wouldn't buy one used.

Only later, generally speaking, did they fill in their lyrics - and then mainly phrasally, only bothering about overall concepts in formula terms (e.g. using the second or third person, aiming towards a sort of punch-line, and so on). Rather than tell a story in traditional Tin Pan Alley style, [they] wrote their lyrics to create a mood or a tone, so as not to get in the way of the effect created by the music and the sound. This bred a casual attitude to normal sense which later turned explicitly free-associational. There was always just enough sense in a lyric for the listener to get the general idea. The rest came from the sum of the parts of the record as a whole. [They] rarely thought long about their lyrics.</i><p>This is, of course, about John Lennon and Paul McCartney in the 1960s.
