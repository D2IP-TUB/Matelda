The earth does not have limbs and muscles; therefore it does not move.</i><p>I wonder if this sounded as dumb back then as it does now?  What about things that do not move under their own power, yet move nonetheless, such as waves and wind?  What about flowers that close every night and open in every morning?  What about the fact that they knew almost nothing about the earth deeper than the tiniest scratch on its surface -- perhaps there <i>are</i> muscles of a sort under there?<p>What about the ""fact,"" as they would have seen it, that God can make anything move however he wants, and that he might have a special mechanism that makes planets and stars move but does not apply the same way to things on Earth?  And did he really believe that the moon and stars have limbs and muscles?<p>I think this illustrates how people can get away with any possible idiocy as long as they are on the right side of an issue.

Yes, even John von Neumann can be guilty of this.  E=mc^2 implies a freaking huge ratio in your favor.  That makes nuclear energy seem of ""virtually limitless"" abundance for the same reason that nuclear bombs seem like ""virtually unstoppable"" weapons.  Yet, simple ball bearings or a complex mechanism like an Orion rocket pusher plate can survive close proximity to a nuclear explosion with some judicious engineering.  If John von Neumann started looking closely at nuclear energy in the broader context of our industrial and political infrastructure, he might have come to a different conclusion.<p>My conclusion is this: One of the best places for opportunities to hide is in the mistaken popular applications of basic principles and physical laws.  This isn't to say that those principles and laws are incorrect, just that the way most people apply them either doesn't go far enough, or fails to also include an economic analysis.<p>This tells us how to look for opportunities hiding behind other common misapplications of principles.

There's always a place for such people, and it's easy for management to understand how someone like that can bring value.<p>OTOH, a personal story:<p>In school, I got excellent grades up until lots of effort was required. At that point my grades went down drastically. This is what comes from being praised as smart, separate from results.<p>It took me a good while after I was out of school to really come to grips with things, and it's still a bit of a struggle. However, I <i>have</i> managed to make a career of programming. I try to play to my strengths, solving tricky problems that don't yield easily to hard work <i>alone</i>. This makes me fairly valuable, though I have to work hard to find employment where management realizes that there are roles for people like me. Currently I develop software in support of the science team on an active NASA space mission. If I can pat myself on the back a bit, that's not bad for someone who took an extra semester to graduate high school and never went to college.<p>So someone smart can learn to work harder and be results oriented, but without help from parents and school I think it's a lot harder and brings delays. What could I have done if I'd been praised for results rather than ""being smart?"" I don't obsess about that, but it comes to mind these days as I raise my child.",1298133473

Even doing so multiple times is not a consideration for admission, e.g. I had five different majors over 12 years at three different universities (plus a stint in vocational school) before earning a bachelor's degree.<p>It is also common people to pursue a bachelor's degree in their 30's or 40's or later.  Culturally, in large part this is a result of the changes to US higher education created by the GI bill following WWII - one of my grandfathers earned his bachelor's degree at the age of 40 following the war and my father in law his bachelor's at 43 after retiring from the navy in the 1970's.<p>But pursuing a degree in later life is not just tied to the GI Bill. One of my brothers-in law earned his bachelor's online at 51, another has earned two Master's degrees after age 40 (bachelor's at 36) and a third earned his bachelor's at 46.<p>None of my relatives would have been considered for the Gymnasium under the German system and my switching majors four times would have been frowned upon within German higher education(from Electrical Engineering to Chemistry to Geology to Chemistry Education to Philosophy)",1298133362
2239297,comment,2238667,2238667,0,0,gardarh,,,"As an Icelander I must say this article is terribly poorly written. I don't really understand what this silent revolution is about. Generally speaking, if a ""revolution"" isn't discussed by any media outlet and cannot be found on Google (in a country where government censorship essentially does not exist) I'd say that it isn't just silent, it simply doesn't exist.<p>There was never a referendum on whether banks should be recapitalized or not, they simply were recapitalized. However there was a referendum on the Icesave deal (about terms of repayments of deposits of UK/Dutch depositors into an Icelandic bank) after the president was petitioned not to agree with the parliament decision to do so. The president formally has power to do this but no president acted on it until the incumbent one in 2004 (50 years after Iceland became a sovereign state) and again in 2010 regarding the Icesave deal. This deal is actually quite different from what the Irish government is currently doing by saving its bank system, the old Icelandic banks did go into bankruptcy in 2008 have since been restarted as new institutions partly owned by the government and partly by the old bankrupt estates. The deal is about sovereign political responsibility and having a national referendum about it is quite paradoxical in my view since the end result is basically asking: Do you want to pay a great deal of money or not?<p>Of course the matter is more complicated than that. And is subject to lengthy spin-filled bullshit ridden politics.<p>About the constituent assembly: It was supposed to have already started but due to legal issues in the elections it hasn't started yet and is in a bit of a limbo. The matter of this assembly is, of course, quite political as well.<p>Finally, the exaggerated comments on ""capitalism"" and ""communism"" in the article are very exaggerated. Iceland has conventionally been a nordic welfare state with a strong healthcare system, public school system, etc. The atmosphere before 2008 was leaning towards the right but shifted a bit to the left after the big bank collapse. It feels to me it's shifting back to the right now as people realize that huge tax hikes aren't that great either.<p>Bottom line: this article is terrible, poorly written and not very informative.
