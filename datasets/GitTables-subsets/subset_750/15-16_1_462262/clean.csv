Many have requested GANTT charts be added to basecamp, but jason et al. don't use them in their pm process so they refuse to ever add them no matter how many people request them.  I know several companies that have been unable to use it due to this lack of a feature.  It's not that we like GANTT charts, but there is a BIG difference in project management between a small design shop (ie 37 signals, most yc type companies, etc.) and a large regulated proprietary engineering company (like my current employer).",1172331757

If you decide to change a vote and click on Back, it takes you right off the page, and if you click on forward again, it restarts.  Why does the thing even have to be flash?

881,comment,721,796,0,0,dangrsmind,,,"I think this advice is somewhat misguided.  I'm currently on my seventh start up. I started two previously myself with my own money, but my current employer is VC and angel backed.  (I am the chief scientist) Relying only on your own resources such as credit card debt or a second mortgage on your home can be a very risky proposition.<p>Not just because you might lose your investment, but because by using your own money you are creating a situation of immense pressure.  The risk of losing your home might lead one to make some bad decisions regarding the business.  You have o be very careful here.<p>My second self funded company eventually did take about $100,000 in angel money.  But we started with only $50,000 of the two founders own money and we operated the business for four years with no other investment.  We eventually sold it to a public software company for $2 million dollars.  This might seem like a pretty decent investment, but at the time (mid 90s) it failed to attract the buzz that seems to feed VC investments.<p>It also depends on how much capital you really need.  Typically entrepreneurs underestimate this, but of course it is also possible to fool yourself the other way.  You have to be very realistic about this to make the right decisions.  My current venture requires us to installhardware in our customers' facilities, so it is somewhat capital intensive.  Only someone who was very wealthy could self fund such an enterprise.<p>In the end VC money spends the same as any other money, so deciding where you get your funds should be a business decision similar to deciding who to hire or what product to develop.  You should interview your investors as they interview you.  But few entrepreneurs do this.  They act desperate, and this often becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.<p>On another note, in my experience, entrepreneurs shouldn't expect most VCs to deliver anything more than money.  Of course they all tell you about the benefits of their strategic connections and so on, but in my experience it is very rare that these bear fruit.  One exception would be a venture fund targeting the specific industry you are developing your product for.  These funds often do have real valuable connections to bring to bear and can help in ways that vanilla VCs can't.",1172330404
