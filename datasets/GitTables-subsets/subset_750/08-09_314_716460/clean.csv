7155933,comment,7154301,7155525,7,0,jmathai,,,"I&#x27;ve done both. In my previous startup (circa 2005) we started at The Planet (are they still around?) and within 18 months we were colocating physical servers at a nearby Level 3.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s gotten better but when we colocated I had to project what type of traffic and storage (photos) we&#x27;d need. That led us to lease a few servers from HP. We were able to reuse hardware we owned already for reporting type tasks. But I got 1TB storage servers when we were using about 1/5 of that.<p>In my current startup (photos, again) we were on AWS from the beginning. I think we could save money <i>now</i> if we wanted. But when we first started out all we needed were 2 micro instances and S3.<p>I&#x27;d say we&#x27;ve increased capacity by 8x since then.<p>But here&#x27;s the kicker. Since we started on AWS we were able to keep our costs fairly low at the beginning <i>and</i> as we grew we never had to make any long term projections. We simply added capacity (literally) on a weekly basis.<p>Once you start to buy into the AWS ecosystem you begin to reap some serious benefits. You simply cannot think of AWS as <i>just</i> EC2 instances. Of course, the trade-off by going all in is some level of lock-in (though this can easily be minimized).<p>Having done both I am happy to pay AWS more for the ecosystem.<p>--<p>We&#x27;re using EC2, ELB, SNS, ElasticTranscoder, RDS, S3, Route53, CloudSearch, CloudFront & Glacier.",1391158541

That is the acid formed by adding carbon dioxide bubbles to soda. Could a giant bottle of Pepsi help cure your cancer? What about shooting up pure Coke, the cola kind?<p>Thought experiment. Take a clean syringe, draw it half full of Coca Cola from a newly opened bottle, stick it in a vein, draw a bit of blood, maybe one or two CCs, shake it a little to mix and leave the needle in the vein for 30 minutes, then inject the whole shebang, slowly with the syringe arranged vertically so that not too much CO2 goes in. Don&#x27;t try this at home since injecting air into veins is bad, and I can&#x27;t quite see how to avoid this with soda unless you have a lot more apparatus to help you with the job.<p>But it is technology that is within the reach of Stone Age people so this gives one pause for thought.

7155897,comment,7133384,7133384,1,0,LauriStahle,,,"For me coming from applied Systems Engineering, I see this as a very good lessons learned sharing - Thanks ! The article just forced me to write down few comments, my emphasis, and thoughts, coming from my background and experience as a Systems Architect.<p>I&#x27;d like to reflect back with my words, that one needs to get customer dialogue and engineering dialogue into balance, to be able to create successful products and/or services and to be able to launch them in time.<p>One has to ensure that the customer needs are refined well for engineering, for product and/or services content decisions and for development. This along with a company own strategical and internal needs and requirements. The engineering process may be agile, lean, waterfall, V etc, but the information, how and by who it is harvested, and what are the dependencies, are very important matters.<p>There are several means to ensure the effective refinement of information. The given lessons and described work sharing looks good and is surely important. E.g. epics were mentioned, and required good PM&PO co-operation.<p>Should the customer categories, portfolio and/or required engineering effort increase, the situation gets more complicated. One needs to ensure that the  information is captured on/by identified locations/roles, and that it&#x27;s refined on for relevant stakeholders e.g. in engineering. In many organizations today, it is impossible to rely on an IT solution stored information as your input data. In many cases personal network is emphasized instead, which makes the operations too much person and person2person relation dependent, as well fragile. For sure the network of colleges is important !<p>We should complement the proposed PM&PO work sharing and good relations are far as possible, BUT with defined information model, tasked refinement roles, and minimum amount of control mechanisms, whatever process is been applied in the organization.",1391157483

7155884,comment,7153395,7155757,1,0,jessedhillon,,,"First, the comment was about the glee with which this person welcomes the demise of a multi-billion dollar company employing thousands of people in this area. I was lamenting that I have to wade through cheap rabble-rousing which I could already predict would be at the top, not because it contained any particular insight or was even well thought out, just because it cheered on some ill-defined hate most readers have for Zynga. I wanted to filter him out because his comment appeared to be so thoughtless and predictable that it adds nothing despite gaining so many votes, and that it was made by a non-local nobody glorifying the potential dismissal of 2000 people from their jobs here. He may actually be very intelligent, but he&#x27;s not contributing to this discussion, just pandering.<p>Whatever else you think that comment was about, disabuse yourself of those notions. It has nothing to do with how likely or not a Zynga bankruptcy is, and whatever the latest financial news may be. It has everything to do with the irrelevance of a drive-by, senseless expression of contempt for a company which is a major employer in this area, and the how/why it has floated to the top of this thread.<p>Second, that you would call my comment obtuse, when you have gone to such great lengths to avoid acknowledge the obvious fact that <i>ecosystems exist</i>, in order to make your comment seem as though it possesses a meaningful understanding of the world -- that, in fact, is the irony. Your entire rebuttal is defeated by situating on a map the locations of top MBA programs, CS programs, VC offices, and all sorts of activity which arise from the clustering of highly talented people. The Bay Area indeed has a <i>critical mass</i> of all these factors -- such is not the case in Seattle, Boston, Chicago, Austin, LA nor the entire European continent.<p>(If you are not aware of the precise meaning of the term critical mass, check Wikipedia. It means more than &quot;really big.&quot;)<p>So yes, if you want to phrase it that way -- <i>a lot of those people are here too</i>. Enough that we have perpetuating institutions which further our advantage, and the rate at which our advantage grows, over the rest of the country. In fact, add to your map, arrows showing where the graduates from <i>other</i> top programs go, and even <i>those</i> arrows terminate here in disportionately large measure. To the detriment of those other locations, hence my conclusion that the largest share of talented people are found here because the incentives are just too great.<p>The obvious question then is, what to conclude from the fact that some programmers are not enjoying those incentives found here? I&#x27;ve given my answer already.<p>Lastly, this is not &quot;my new argument,&quot; as if I have changed the subject somehow. This thread emanates from a parenthetical I made in my original comment, which people such as yourself have chosen to take extremely personally -- mainly because you cannot understand the difference between the statement &quot;most of those programmers are mediocre&quot; and &quot;all of those programmers are mediocre.&quot;<p>Somehow, though, I&#x27;d guess that you don&#x27;t shed so many tears when you read that the average man measures 5&#x27;10&quot; in height.
