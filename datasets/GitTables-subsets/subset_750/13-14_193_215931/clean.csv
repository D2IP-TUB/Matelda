Or perhaps there is some other factor (handedness, the side you sleep on, the side of the car you usually sit in, etc.) that both biases cancer to one side of the head and influences which hand you use to talk on the cell phone.",1212674101

209880,comment,209719,209719,0,0,olavk,,,"The ECMAScript 4 support is only part of the goal of the project. Another part is to check integrity in existing classic JavaScript by performing static analysis. For example, inheritance through prototypes or other JavaScript patterns can (at least to a certain extent) be statically inferred, which allows us to catch a number of errors.<p>One idea I have been toying with, is to allow type annotations in comments on existing JavaScript, eg.<p><pre><code>    /* type Point = {x : int, y: int}; */\n    var p /* : Point */ = {x: 10, y: 100};\n</code></pre>\nUgly, yes, but might be a viable path for developers who are not ready to jump ship to ES4, but still would like better integrity checks. I believe this becomes more desirable the large the code base.",1212673623

Yosemite Park, Tahoe Lake, Death Valley, Grand Canyon are a MUST. Santa Cruz, Monterey, Carmel are very beautiful places to enjoy ocean view and beaches.<p>If you are not afraid to walk, go to the top of the Dome in Yosemite Park. You won't regret it.<p>Grand Canyon is very impressive. I specially recommend a flight with a small plane over the canyon. Unforgetable.<p>For the cities, I didn't see a lot, but SF and the bay area is great. I also liked spending time in Santa Monica. Vegas is good to see, but I spent only one night there and I think it was enough.<p>I also enjoyed visiting Universal Studio in LA.<p>Enjoy your time there !",1212673239

I've encountered it several times before, and you can Google ""denialist creationist"" to find more.<p>Me trying to refute martythemaniak may not impress you, but if when you first read that topmodded post you nodded vaguely, might there be some validity in Crichton's implication that the arguments invoked for AGW could be arguments for eugenics if you filed off the serial numbers? It's an offensive charge, but it's not a goofy one IMHO: it is far more true of the arguments for AGW than of the arguments for actual ""settled science"" like quantum mechanics or natural selection or antibiotics or the Big Bang.<p>""What are good sources to read, that are not opinionated?""<p>One non-opinionated source as background both for my exasperation about the Darwinist analogy, and for my claims about the flabbiness of 10-year-old climate predictions, which also happens to be interesting reading for hackers interested in machine learning: _The Minimum Description Length Principle_. Lots of math to help you think precisely about questions like ""by how many bits did this hypothesis reduce the surprisingness of the world compared to alternative hypotheses?""<p>For sources more specific to the AGW controversy, good luck finding someone unopinionated. The controversy long ago became uncivil, and all sides are indignant about various scummy folk who have lined up on other sides. But I can point you to sources that seem (opinionated but) sound. As far as I know, the IPCC reports (see martythemaniak's URL) are a reasonably good presentation of the highbrow case for crisis AGW (high CO2 climate sensitivity, low natural variation): I've never seen an advocate claim that vital parts of the pro-crisis case were overlooked or horribly poorly presented there. And I think McIntyre's critiques of the IPCC reports --- mostly centered on the historical climate record reconstruction I mentioned --- are generally sound. He has a website, Climate Audit; he has also written the Mann critique up as at least one traditional journal paper. Besides his Mann critique, he has also done things like catching a Y2K bug in temperature records. (Of course that's not impressive as virtuoso rocket science, but I think it's pretty convincing evidence that he's a careful guy who does a lot of homework.) It is natural for AGWists to find him irritating, but it is inexcusable to try to dismiss him as a ignorant closedminded crank by analogy with modern disbelievers in natural selection.<p>And besides the math and technical background, some academic sociology background: McIntyre is not the only opinionated grouchy outsider who has torpedoed a politically correct prestigious academic consensus in the last decade or so, Cramer did too: <a href=""http://law.bepress.com/nwwps/lep/art9/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.bepress.com/nwwps/lep/art9/</a> .",1212671580
