8404850,comment,8402859,8403227,0,0,dognotdog,,,"I believe what is described is repetition, but not rote learning. That, to me, means memorizing facts without connecting the dots. Rote memorization is learning for an exam by memorizing the previous years&#x27; problems, or learning history by memorizing dates and events. If I focus on knowing the previous years problems by heart, I may accidentally make the connections to be able to solve more varied problems, but thats rather inefficient. Similarly, knowing historical dates doesn&#x27;t imply an understanding of why and how things happened.<p>Learning different conjugations of verbs by using them in sentences isn&#x27;t rote learning, either. It&#x27;s rather the opposite, trying to connect the new verb into the existing knowledge of the language.<p>Rote learning alone is useless for most students. Repetition is certainly important in retaining information, no doubt about it, but as with the math examples, you need to apply basic arithmetic in the context of solving equations, for example, to really get a &quot;feel&quot; for it, a sort of automatism where you not only know how to do 1+1, but also WHEN to use this knowledge.<p>As far as complex algorithms and such go, I do believe they can be broken down into pieces, but you really do have to know the pieces and their relations and implications innately, and with complex algorithms, it&#x27;s really hard to know all the pieces of the puzzle, and sometimes even finding out what is missing is difficult. You can drill something ad infinitum without gaining anything if you&#x27;re missing something.<p>I believe this to be the secret skill that the article omits. In order to learn effectively, you have to recognize where your knowledge is lacking, find out what it is you should know, and drill those parts. A teacher should help students find these gaps and help fill them. The rest is just a little bit of willpower and discipline.",1412329762

From what I could see, most people learned maths by just memorising the process. Except for a few who invested an exceptional amount of effort, they scored poorly. In contrast, everyone who I knew who focused on gaining a deep understanding was able to pick up maths quickly.<p>There is one area, though, where there is probably too much focus on understanding at the cost of memorisation and that is in the Olympiads. I remember that many of us held the rather uncharitable attitude that the people who tried to succeed in maths by memorising it were &#x27;stupid&#x27;. But clearly, understanding combined with targeted memorisation of the key building blocks will lead to the most success.",1412327801

8404788,comment,8404612,8404612,0,0,teddyh,,,"Here is a question I hoped to be answered, but it wasn’t: Why doesn’t the HTTP/2 protocol use SRV DNS records¹?  Using it would solve some real problems:<p>1. The well-known resilience of mail can be largely attributed to its use of MX records to specify the use of backup servers and/or load balancing.  SRV records are essentially a generalization of MX records for any service, not just mail, so using SRV records would bring this benefit to any protocol which uses them.<p>2. The problem of “www” or no “www” would be entirely eliminated; no need for non-standard so-called ANAME or ALIAS “records”.  Just imagine – if, in an alternate universe, mail servers <i>hadn’t</i> used MX records, it would then have been necessary to have an A record on the bare domain name, and later, when the Web was created in this alternate universe, the web server would have to be the <i>same</i> server as the mail server, since both now would use the bare domain name.  In our universe, this position is now solely occupied by the HTTP protocol, which causes lots of pain in the DNS when redundant (and harder to update) A records need to be put on the bare domain name just for HTTP.  Not to mention IPv6, which, for HTTP to work, requires an <i>additional</i> AAAA record on the bare domain.<p>3. The “everything is on port 80, let’s reinvent everything on top of HTTP” problem could certainly have been entirely avoided, and could be slowly fixed, by using SRV records.  (A server concerned about clients needing to traverse old-style restrictive firewalls could provide a low-priority port 80 server as a fallback.)<p>① <i>A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)</i> <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2782"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2782</a>",1412327638

Frankly, each type of company she discussed (B2B, consumer, etc) could be expanded into their own talks.<p>One point that rang true was when she said that you may hit a point where the economics of a specific business don&#x27;t make sense. IME, the economics of a business often look one way before you start, but become increasingly real as you gain early experience with the business.
