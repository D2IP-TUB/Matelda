We all eat mostly unprocessed food - almost 95%, even at restaurants or when we eat out food&#x27;s unprocessed but definitely contaminated ( food colors, pesticides etc ). Urban elites are moving towards processed food, but it&#x27;ll take a really long time before processed food takes over - I really hope that day doesn&#x27;t ever come.<p>However, it pains me to see that in the western world, you need to take an extra effort beyond your means just to eat right, and it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive for a common man earning minimum wage to do that. So for scalable nutrition in this rapidly urbanizing world, Soylent and similar solutions are my only hope.",1429610114

9413031,comment,9412733,9412733,0,0,csallen,,,"I&#x27;ve always found the various debates, fads, and gimmicks related to healthy eating interesting for a couple of reasons.<p>First, the word &quot;healthy&quot; is problematic due to its ambiguity. It means very different things to different people. If you&#x27;re overweight, then it means whatever helps you lose weight. If you have high blood pressure, it means whatever helps you fight high blood pressure. If you&#x27;re a bodybuilder, it means whatever helps you build muscle and burn fat. If you&#x27;re an athlete, it means whatever helps you perform the best. For many people, it means whatever helps them live the longest. Or feel the best. Or look the best. In other words, it depends on your goals. Given so much room for interpretation, it seems downright irresponsible for anyone to write an article about healthy eating without making explicit their particular definition of &quot;healthy&quot;. But alas, it happens more often than not, and no one seems to notice or care.<p>Second, as far longevity and diseases go, diet is only one of many significant players. Among other things, our mortality is affected by our genes, macro and micro environments and exposure to various chemicals, exercise and physical fitness, medical treatment quality, stress, relationships, etc. It therefore stands to reason that there are diminishing returns to how your diet affects your life expectancy -- beyond a certain point, continuing to eat &quot;healthier&quot; will have a near-negligible effect on your health compared to other factors. And yet people remain obsessive about fine-tuning their diets based rumors and inconclusive studies, even as they continue to sit at stressful desk jobs for 9 hours a day in smog-filled cities. I wonder if it&#x27;s because diet is (or, at least, seems) easier to control than competing factors? Or maybe it&#x27;s that deliberately putting substances into our bodies all day every day is an intuitively health-related action?",1429609877

The first book was given to me as a young teenager, looking through his way to live and I am pretty sure that it took a huge part of my religious beliefs later(not exactly atheism, but agnosticism mostly).<p>But The Night Watch... It&#x27;s a book, that I have rereaded over ten times in the last 3 years and will continue reading it. It is a time travel story, where the main commander of police forces goes back in time and has to be a part of a revolution. I mean, I can talk about it for ages, but I really don&#x27;t want to spoil it, so go ahead check it out(although to fully grasp the ideas of the book you should read the first few books of the Watch series, but believe me all of them are worth it).<p>Something else that I loved to read when I was younger(12-14) was Winnetou, but my tries to check it again once I get into my 20s wasn&#x27;t successfull, so maybe it was just a phase.<p>Chronicles of Amber is another great fantasy series which I would love to recommend, although the series wasn&#x27;t finished and is left in a pretty huge cliffhanger, but yet the 10(shortish) books are all awesome and the world, that Zelazny has built is easily one of the best built world in fantasy scene.",1429609778

9413022,comment,9412733,9412922,0,0,dschiptsov,,,"There is a so much of nonsense about food that it is worth it to look back at some traditional or tribal eating habits.<p>For example, traditionally, majority of the Nepalese population is eating white rice with some kind of lentil curry and seasonal vegetables two times a day basically  <i>whole year</i> and remain healthy and not overweight due to their active, working lifestyle. Modern memes are telling us  that white rice is almost poisonous, despite the fact that more than half of the world population (almost whole Asia) feed on it.<p>Tibetans, Sherpas and other Himalayan tribes are still rely heavily on cow/nak butter (the main commodity and the source of nutrition) and Tsampa (rusted barley flour) which they consume on a daily basis in the form of so-called Sherpa tea (butter, Tsampa, hot watter, sugar or salt) or in a form of bread-like mass (same ingredients). According to modern memes this is a disastrous diet, but, you see, these people are healthy and happy.<p>I could go on, about various tribes of India or Sri Lanka (mostly rise and veges). The picture will be almost the same. Simple, homemade food and not being a couch potato makes it.<p>There is no problem with traditional foods. The problems are with the food industry and its commercial products which, being aggressively marketed, altered the traditional eating habits.<p>As for myself, I could confirm that especially in high altitudes (in Himalayas) the tribal eating habits, which I follow happily, are the evolved balance for energy storage and intake, according with the harsh conditions, seasons and available food sources. There is no alternative in calories efficiency to the a half-kilo lump of nak butter (just cream, no additions) and a small bag of Tsampa for weeks-long crossing of the ridges in Himalayas.",1429609698

A female who prefers chins will give birth to sons with chins and daughters who like chins. It&#x27;s a positive feedback loop that doesn&#x27;t need cooperation from natural selection to give it fitness.<p>At one time in the past there may have been a reason that the men with chins were more successful than other humans. The correlation may have been coincidental though. Maybe the men with no-chins happened to be living in a part of the world that suffered a famine. Or if there was a direct relationship, the sexual preference remained after the natural advantage was no longer relevant.<p>The study does a good eliminating mechanical advantage as a reason for having a jaw. (And that&#x27;s all it says.) But the speculation about why the jaw exists (inserted by the news writer and has nothing to do with this study) seems less certain to me. Why did chins not simply get smaller with the rest of the skull? Something encouraged chin growth in humans.
