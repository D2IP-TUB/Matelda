In practice, I mentally keep a tab on how my computer is running -- my computer&#x27;s CPU usage, network activity, I/O activity, internet connection speed, etc. so I can tell when something&#x27;s not going right.\nI don&#x27;t keep crapware on my computer either, so when a process shows up that I don&#x27;t recognize, then I can easily tell. I have notifications set up for newly-installed system services, so when a new service or driver is installed I get a popup for that too.<p>Obviously, I can&#x27;t <i>prove</i> it&#x27;s malware-free, but who cares? I don&#x27;t need to.\nI simply have <i>no</i> evidence in support of malware existing on my computer, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it isn&#x27;t. Just like you can&#x27;t mathematically prove to me that your car is OK, I can&#x27;t mathematically prove to you that my computer is running OK. But that doesn&#x27;t matter because I&#x27;m reasonably sure it is, and I have no evidence to believe otherwise. And that&#x27;s really all that matters.<p>And for that matter, it&#x27;s not like I could be <i>sure</i> I didn&#x27;t have malware if I <i>did</i> follow those practice either.

Now, I&#x27;m being encouraged by the fact that these languages have already paid efforts to sophisticate repeating process, because that teaches me there certainly are some people who need that as I do. Unintentionally, Gura ends up to be what tries to inherit these language&#x27;s feature just like today&#x27;s major OOP languages are affected by their ancestors like Smalltalk.<p>Do you think that an effort to sophisticate repeating process has much less significance than OOP paradigm? I don&#x27;t. Repeat is a quite primitive part of programming and is likely be a critical bottleneck of performance. Gura&#x27;s mapping feature is aimed to eliminate side effects from a repeating loop so that it can be optimized for higher performance with parallel computing.<p>Actually, the topic of parallel computing is currently just an idea, and you can&#x27;t get any benefit regarding it for now.

The reality I have experienced is that working with a large codebase in Python (talking 100kloc+ here, and teams larger than 3) is an absolute nightmare.  Lack of explicit typing on argument values and returns means that everytime you add an argument to a function, or move things around, you are frantically grepping trying to find all the callers and hoping that you caught all of them.  Add in the more functional aspects such as passing functions around and lambdas and *args and kwargs and different return types depending on function behavior and it gets very ugly.  Given the fact that adding functionality and refactoring are the most common activities when working with a large existing codebase, this becomes very old, very quickly.

I had no idea what in this course and its sequel were important to me. But then a bank mentions how Standard Treasury should understand repo markets, and then I watched the lectures on that topic.<p>So the idea of consuming courses in modules is very appealing to me, and honestly how I consumed most classes in college: the material prescribed was basically incidental to what I ultimately learned about the topic. I&#x27;m the type of person who gets really focused on some applied problem and then teach myself the, for example, CS, stats, measure theory, machine learning, etc, to do what I want on the problem.<p>Tangent: My only compliant so far is that the (pure) math I can find in MOOCs goes exactly to the point I stopped: advanced calculus and theoretical matrix algebra. I don&#x27;t expect it to have the types of statistics classes I&#x27;d like (I majored in the topic) but I&#x27;m annoyed that I can&#x27;t really find an analysis course...",1408946579
