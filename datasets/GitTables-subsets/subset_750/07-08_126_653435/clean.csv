7788389,comment,7783201,7788358,2,0,bane,,,"Rent will <i>almost</i> always go up. If I rented my house the moment I bought it, I would be running a nice deficit and have nowhere to live. Today I can rent it out and the market rate will make me enough money I can then go rent a 2 bed room apartment and still have a surplus. This is because my mortgage costs either stay the same or drop...in dollars priced at the year I borrowed the money originally. While the rental rate increases have matched or exceeded inflation every year since then.<p>If I bought a home in my neighborhood and rented it out tomorrow, I&#x27;d take a hit on it for maybe 4 or 5 years, about $100-200/mo. But trends show I&#x27;d match my outlays after that and within 10 years have made all my losses back plus a monthly profit plus whatever property appreciation the market has decided to give me.<p>TBH, being a landlord is a huge PIA for the reasons you hint at, which is why lots of people don&#x27;t do it, but financially it can make easy sense if you can stomach a few years of losses till rents rise enough to exceed your outlay. Ideally you&#x27;d rent at market rates, when your mortgage and other expenses were far below market rate. That&#x27;s the situation I&#x27;m in now, my monthly expenses are about 50-60% of the market rate rental price for a house like the one I live in. My wife and I have already decided that when we move, we&#x27;re just going to rent this property out and use it to make money. Even with the overhead of a property management company, we&#x27;ll come out in the black every month. If we stay here, we&#x27;re on track to pay off the entire mortgage in 2-3 years anyway and then we&#x27;ll be living for close to free (minus HOA and property taxes). We could both live comfortably on part time jobs at Target at that point.<p>One of the problems I see in many of the Rent vs Buy comparisons is that people who favor renting seem to think landlords are a charity of some kind who magically make all the extra costs of owning a property disappear. But nobody is in the landlord business to lose money like this, as much as the market will bear, your goal as a landlord is to pass along as many possible costs to your renter as you can and not just rely on property value appreciation to dig you out of your financial hole in 20 years this includes, but is not limited to: HOA fees, utilities, taxes, appliances, repairs and maintenance, common area service, <i>everything</i>.",1400831904

If you bought and then the bottom drops out--which, potentially, causes you to need to move for work so you have to sell low--then this isn&#x27;t as feasible.  Second, you also take on the risk of being a landlord, so you&#x27;re now responsible for the maintenance and upkeep on two or more properties and you get the cost of vacancies.<p>True that your housing costs will eventually drop to near-zero (upkeep and property taxes always exist), but renting out your place won&#x27;t always help you with that.  Besides, more and more people are winding up in blasted Homeowners&#x27; Associations with deed restrictions that prevent renting entirely or more than a certain, small, percentage of rentals.<p>Ultimately, as you said, the decision is an individual one, but the conclusion is usually far from easy.<p>(Even more bonus fun: Try accidentally being the landlord of someone who decides to cook meth in one of your rentals.

Similar to concepts such as Creative Commons, and Open Source Software Licenses, the idea is to create Open Patent License(s) that standardize a method to share intellectual property with the Community. While this does not directly solve the problem, I think it is a necessary first step towards realizing that we (as a Community) can leverage the existing broken Patent System in a way that favors us (the Community). Not only does this have the potential to accelerate innovation, it will also prevent Patent Trolls from claiming ownership of innovations, and that&#x27;s a big deal. These Trolls currently use a Licensing approach to extort people (pay our Licensing Fee or else we will sue). I think it would be ironic (and awesome) to use the same approach to effectively null Patent Trolls. Considering how ineffective Legal Reform is, this might be our best bet; To come together collectively as a Community and decide that we want to take a stand and start using the System in a new and different way. It would be a double win, accelerate innovation and null Patent Trolling. If this sounds interesting, the website is <a href=""http://www.openpatentfoundation.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openpatentfoundation.com</a> and I recently moved to Mountain View, so I&#x27;m looking to spend more time on this and see if we can get some Community Support.",1400829397
