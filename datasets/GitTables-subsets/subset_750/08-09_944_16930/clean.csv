10105027,comment,10102549,10103911,0,0,nnq,,,"> the ability to read it left to right seems like a huge win<p>It&#x27;s only a win if your mind actually needs the &quot;left to right representation&quot;. For me, reading that &quot;if&quot; is more like:<p><pre><code>    1. oh, so this condition is and-ing 2 child conditions, so they must both be true\n    2. now the first sub-condition... ok, so it just sees if form-method is truth-y\n    3. now the 2nd one... ok, so we&#x27;re comparing if two things are equal... let&#x27;s see what these things are\n    4. so request-method must be equal to post\n</code></pre>\n...and the full code-to-English translation would be, for me, something like this: &quot;if two things are truthy, the first of which being form-method, and the second being that there is equality between request-method and :post&quot;. This is how it would sound like if I translated my thoughts of this code into English :)<p>The advantages of people who think more like you would be that:<p><pre><code>    1. you probably find it *much easier* to explain your thoughts about code to others, since translating thought to words is a piece of cake for you (I envy you verbal thinkers for this a lot! :) )\n    2. you can easily map code to math formulas, and figure out differences between them (I can do this easily too, but I just need to use a more complicated algorithm in my head)\n</code></pre>\nThe advantages of the people who think more like me would be:<p><pre><code>    1. breaking complicated stuff into smaller pieces that can be understood off-context is easier (try breaking up the sentence I just wrote above at each comas and see that they kind of make sense separately too)\n    2. thinking about meta-code (code that generates code like Lisp and Scala macros) is much easier: because our mind&#x27;s representation is closer to the machine&#x27;s AST representation, writing code that writes code that writes code etc. feel just as &quot;natural&quot; as everything else to us. For example, when thinking about implementing an ORM, my first thought is something like &quot;oh god, if the language I&#x27;m working in just had *real macros*, I could write all this in a few hours and couple hundreds line of code, and not need a mind-bending hierarchy of classes to do it&quot; :)\n</code></pre>\nAs an example of meta-thinking in a verbal language... try reading some Kant or other such philosopher ...it&#x27;s just <i>too hard</i> to be able to get to any result fast enough, so probably a bad idea...<p><i>The whole point I&#x27;m trying to make is simply that people think very very differently! Indeed, the Lisp advocates should stop repeating the &quot;it&#x27;s awesome&quot; mantra and understand that it&#x27;s only awesome for those with the brain wired a certain way, and it&#x27;s probably painful for the others.</i><p>Nirvana would be to port Lisp&#x27;s features to a more math-like and English-like language. But nobody has been successful at this. Both Scala macros and Template-Haskell are <i>truly fucking hard</i> if you try to actually use them for getting stuff done. So I count them just as failed experiments. But there&#x27;s always hope :)",1440318882

However, if properly used, it will be absolutely secure and unbreakable&quot;, I&#x27;ve had to talk developers out of wanting to implement them in their protocols before.<p>Quick public service announcement about cryptography.<p>It&#x27;s true that, from an information theory perspective, OTPs are unbreakable encryption.<p>However, unless you have a long history of cryptanalysis under your belt, don&#x27;t even think about implementing one in software. This is a common mistake people make when they&#x27;re first learning about cryptography.<p>Pitfalls:<p>1. You need to get two computers to have the same large chunk of random data without anyone knowing it. This becomes a horrendous key management problem.<p>2. Even if you don&#x27;t know the one-time pad, if you flip bits in transit, the recipient will happily decrypt them. You can forge messages at will. OTP is unauthenticated encryption.<p>If you think your application needs one-time pads, use elliptic curve diffie hellman key agreement and stream ciphers instead (and remember to authenticate you ciphertext).<p>Better yet, hook into a library like libsodium to do this for you and don&#x27;t play with fire.

It has nothing to do with anything other than marketing strategy: find a under served market segment and empower idiots to do mediocre+ works with little efforts. In order to achieve so, language designers have to break old paradigms, simply because if they don&#x27;t, the less capable people at the time just don&#x27;t understand, nor capable of (otherwise, they would be professionals).<p>Most of the (most) popular languages aren&#x27;t revolutionary and they&#x27;re also weak in terms of level of abstraction.<p>Reading your comment, one would assume that Lisp, batteries included-Schemes, Python, Ruby, Perl, Haskell, etc. are topping the charts. In reality, though, people are mostly using Java, C, C++, C# and yes... Python is very popular.

The most popular languages are the ones with a lower level of abstraction, less expressive power and that require a programmer to write/manage more to do less, meaning they make more effort for these &#x27;mediocre+&#x27; results.<p>A point can be made that you think less while using these languages, but what time you don&#x27;t spend on thinking is spent on writing (and then debugging) and I guess this is the &#x27;less capable&#x27; part of your post, but this doesn&#x27;t cover the fact that the languages that&#x27;ve enabled people to leapfrog business professionals (think Ruby + Rails being used to leapfrog professionals in web development) have almost nothing in common with the top list of used programming languages.<p>The most used programming languages remain and have pretty much always been languages that use C syntax and don&#x27;t actually push the envelope too much. Some rankings will have PHP and JS up there with the rest of them, but these fall neatly into the fold and are about as &#x27;lame&#x27; as the rest of the top (with JS trying to walk lately).",1440318640

A few ideas:<p>- Hiring is only part of your wider planning process.  Do you know what you need to do in the future?  If so, use that as a guide.<p>- Hiring is only part of your wider budgeting process.  You will want to create a financial plan for your business, in order to force yourself to be explicit about your assumptions, and to work out whether there is a viable business there.<p>- Other similar companies may provide some indication of what you need, e.g. if you&#x27;re a SaaS business then you could look at other SaaS business with similar customers and deal sizes, to figure out how many sales people you need for a given volume of sales.  But you should probably do your own thinking bottom up first, rather than just triangulating from external data.",1440318331

An example:<p><pre><code>    #include <memory>\n    struct Gadget;\n    struct BlackBox {\n        std::unique_ptr<Gadget> contents;\n        ~BlackBox();\n    };\n    \n    void func() {\n        BlackBox b;\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\nThis will fail to compile (for reasons I don&#x27;t understand - can anyone explain?)

The difference is that with the latter moving the object does not change the properties (the context comes along), while the first one might lose the properties in case something made moving outside the intended envelope possible.<p>The approach taken by Tame is technically easier to implement without shooting yourself in the foot, and featured also in Grsecurity fame&#x27;s RBAC implementation. Jolly good.<p>The thing just is, the approach taken by SELinux with the external security daemon can and has been extended beyond files. Tracking the information by its properties when it moves from files to database, web servers, etc, is a powerful (but extremely hard for implementors) feature. Also, administratively the security classifications of documents are properties of documents, not the storage containers they are found from.",1440317679
