I believe this is due to factors such as the breed of cattle, the type of cattle feed (which is sometimes season dependent) and processing techniques. Supermarket milk is commonly from Friesian cows, but sometimes from Ayrshire cows (especially in Scotland) or from Jersey cows (especially in South West England). My personal favourite is non-homogenised milk from Ayrshire cows.",1428235087

9323795,comment,9323401,9323699,0,0,dennybritz,,,"Sounds like good advice, but here&#x27;s another take on it: I&#x27;m in my 20s and didn&#x27;t save any of the money I made. I immediately spent (on startups, travel or invested in myself) all of it. I have a bit of debt but not too much. I don&#x27;t regret a single bit of it. I&#x27;ve lived in 5 different countries for longer periods of time, met amazing people from all over the world, and had a blast. I wouldn&#x27;t trade these experiences for anything. And because I invested most of the money in myself I found that I obtained a lot of skills, experiences and relationships that allow me to make a lot more money in the future than I would have if I had followed a regular career path for a couple of years.<p>Too many people undervalue time and health and overvalue money. You can always make money. But you&#x27;re only young once. IMO the best thing you can do is invest time and money in yourself, not in any kind of fund. The lifetime ROI is higher.",1428234989

As a family with $140,000 in income and what I would consider to be typical assets (modest home, minimal retirement and college savings) we received no financial aid offers of any kind and were expected to be able to pay $65-70,000 per year at private colleges.<p>Luckily, my daughter found an excellent out-of-state public college that she loves and should graduate debt-free.  Unfortunately, too many of her high school friends fell into the private school trap and are now either paying outrageous tuition or are stuck in a mediocre in-state public school.<p>To any parents now making college visits, ignore those press releases, insist that you visit as many public campuses as you do private ones, and that your children apply to as many public schools as they do private schools and you won&#x27;t live to regret it.",1428234491

I grant you - and as a German by birth I used to think about it a lot - that Germans are especially vulnerable to this. Honestly I witnessed abuse of power far more often from public servants (if you need to interact directly with a low-rung city official here you&#x27;re pretty much hosed), and I won&#x27;t deny that everyday citizen-on-citizen malice has a special quality in this country to this day.<p>But it&#x27;s been my experience that police officers are indeed mostly in it to help people.

They&#x27;re often about providing a &quot;life experience&quot; for undergraduates.  So you have a huge investment in sports, entertainment, and living facilities that are basically unheard of in other countries.  Plus, all sort of administrators and advisors who help students in a variety of different ways.<p>These add up to a great experience, and arguably make the education better.  But they also reflect how little the US government provides vs. other countries.  And how much students depend on the university to provide services that in other countries would be provided by other agencies.  And how an American university is expected to provide much more than just classrooms, lectures, and research.<p>I graduated from two American universities (MIT and Northwestern).  Each of these had an on-site medical facility (unnecessary in countries with nationalized health insurance), financial aid offices (unnecessary in places where the tuition is lower, or handled by centralized government agencies), student-only shuttle services (unnecessary where public transportation is good), sports teams (unheard of outside of the US), and a wide variety of extra-curriculars (again, basically non-existent outside of the US).  Each of these requires a bunch of administrators.<p>The building in which I did my PhD had a huge support staff.  In an Israeli or European university, I think that the 15-20 secretaries, planners, and managers would have been replaced by 3-4 people.  Overworked and underpaid people, mind you, but that&#x27;s how you keep costs low.  And my office (as a graduate student) in the US was positively opulent compared to what you&#x27;ll find abroad.<p>I used to think that student aid in the US was a great thing.  But I do believe that American universities have basically decided that they can raise tuition without any penalty, because almost no one pays that sum out of pocket -- and everyone else just takes on crushing debt for many years to follow.<p>Now, the fact is that I had a blast in my undergrad years, and my experience editing the student newspaper led directly to my current career.  But having met many students and graduates in Israel (where I live), where universities are places to learn and do research, rather than have &quot;life experiences,&quot; I&#x27;m not at all convinced that the added expense and overhead are worthwhile.",1428233112

A couple of months ago I came home at noon and noticed a small group of what looked like thugs loitering at the front door of my neighbor&#x27;s house.

Two of the thugs blocked my way and the shouting guy exclaimed &quot;move along, there is nothing to see here&quot;.<p>This was the point when I was getting out my phone and started dialing the police emergency number, just as two trucks of the fire department and a police van were moving in from opposite ends of the street, coming to a halt in front of the house. Uniformed people swarmed out and joined what I had assumed to be thugs before. Turns out they were plain-clothes officers.<p>In the end, it came out it was a pot raid, but apparently nothing was found. In slightly different circumstances, this could have escalated quickly. The plain clothes officers were clearly looking for trouble. At the very least they were enjoying their effect on the civilians.

That&#x27;s only as many hours as most full time employees work every 3 weeks!<p>The comparison doesn&#x27;t seem fair. First, I suppose you have others classes at the same time.
