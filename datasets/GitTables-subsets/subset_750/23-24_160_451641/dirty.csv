Look for a subject matter expert (SME) in the market vertical you are going after.  They should be able to give you all the info you need to penetrate that market (customer pains, sales strategies, introductions, price points, etc). Al they have to do is tell you what to build, then sell it.<p>If you're a hustler looking for a hacker, it's much more difficult.  Any hacker that's actually capable of playing an integral role in your success is already working on another project.  The only place I know of where you can find decent talent is in corporate America.  Find the person living the office space movie and offer them a path to freedom.<p>If you're a hustler looking for a hacker, you have to be one hell of a hustler to get any respect.  You have to nail down every possible non-technical aspect of the opportunity.  And it better be one hell of a good plan you put together.  It has to be so well put together that the hacker knows immediately you are the real deal and all the hacker has to do is hack.<p>Being a hacker who's been approached by a lot of hustlers over the years, let's just say you have your work cut out for you (assuming you're the hustler looking for a hacker).",1309823900

2728174,comment,2727457,2727457,15,0,kragen,,,"No.<p>Google has an orientation that is opposed to my agenda.<p>I joined the internet in 1992.  It was a pretty decentralized place, and any person on it could set up an online service accessible to any other person on it; but you pretty much had to write your service in C (less of a security worry at the time) and it was easy to get in trouble by bogging down the DECStation you shared with fifty other people.  So it was such a hassle that there were only a few dozen online services, plus a few thousand FTP sites.  As an example, there were no public porn sites, although there was lots of porn.<p>A few years later, when the internet hit mainstream, it was a decentralizing force; server-centric Novell LANs and mainframe-terminal networks gave way to workstation networks, where anybody at the company, or anybody with an ISP account, could set up a web server on their personal workstation with a little trouble.<p>I started running my own mail and web server when I moved to Ohio in 1997, and I've been running one ever since, first alone and later with half a dozen friends.  Until 2001 it was on dialup, which was fine, although obviously there are limits on how much traffic I could cope with.<p>But this rosy picture is complicated by centralizing forces. Apple wants to relegate websites to second-class status on their popular computers, and exercises viewpoint censorship on what ""apps"" they allow in their ""app store"".  Google wants you to keep your mail in Gmail instead of on your home computer (with backups, naturally, on your friends' home computers), and they'll delete your account with no recourse if you admit you're only 10.  Microsoft won't let you run unsigned device drivers on your own computer any more.  Facebook wants to know every web page you visit and log that information permanently for later analysis.<p>And email from our little mail server automatically gets dropped into the spam box on Gmail these days.  Not sure why.  Apparently our domain has a ""bad reputation"", but even finding that out required an inside connection; no way to find out more.<p>I imagine a different future, where if Alice wants to talk to Bob and Bob wants to talk to Alice, there's no unaccountable intermediary that can interfere with their communication, whether they're speaking text, or video, or 3-D models, or simulation.  If Alice's email gets marked as spam, Bob ought to be able to find out why — and fix it!<p>We're a lot closer to that world today than we were in 1992, and the evidence suggests that it is to that that we owe the collapse of oppressive regimes throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa; the revelation and destruction of the nascent government-funded slander campaign against Glenn Greenwald and other WikiLeaks supporters; and the public discovery of the CIA's ""extraordinary rendition"" flights.  If we successfully beat back the global menaces of governmental corruption, global warming, overfishing, and terrorism, it will be because we were able to collaborate and organize more effectively around the world by means of this new medium.<p>Google, of course, wants to solve these problems too.  But it has a different, less-democratic approach in mind.  While of course the company contains an enormous diversity of opinion internally, their approach publicly has been somewhat paternalistic, and their engineering culture is organized around big centralized solutions; warehouse-scale computing, as the title of Barroso and Hölzle's excellent book puts it.<p>A rather shocking view of the depth of some Googlers' commitment to centralized computing can be found at <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/web/05/11/google.skype.wired/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/web/05/11/google.skype.wire...</a><p>I believe that warehouse-scale client-server computing will, in the end, undermine the kind of democratic freedom of communication that we need to deal with today's global menaces.  It's more practical than peer-to-peer computing at the moment, but that pendulum has swung back and forth several times over the decades.  (Some of my friends were among the first employees of a hot cloud-computing startup, in 1964, called Tymshare.)  The proper response to the current impracticality of decentralized computing is not to sigh and build centralized systems.  The proper response is to build the systems to <i>make decentralized computing practical again</i>.<p>Google is not institutionally opposed to this; they've funded substantial and important work on it.  Nevertheless, because of their overall orientation toward centralized solutions, I believe working there would be a further distraction from that goal.  Worse, with every advance that companies like Google and Apple make, the higher is the bar that decentralized systems must leap to achieve real adoption.<p>I'm not making much progress on that.  My friends Len Sassaman (who committed suicide yesterday), Bram Cohen, Jacob Appelbaum, and Zooko O'Whielacronx have made substantial contributions.  But I don't think I'd make <i>more</i> progress at Google, and I might make <i>negative</i> progress.",1309822532
2728173,comment,2727960,2727960,11,0,hebejebelus,,,"FTA: ""When Picard and el Kaliouby were calibrating their prototype, they were surprised to find that the average person only managed to interpret, correctly, 54 per cent of Baron-Cohen's expressions on real, non-acted faces. This suggested to them that most people - not just those with autism - could use some help sensing the mood of people they are talking to. ""People are just not that good at it,"" says Picard. The software, by contrast, correctly identifies 64 per cent of the expressions.""<p>I kind of wonder how they did this testing. Much of the information we get about a person's mood is from what context there is (far more than comes from what's on their faces). There are people who cry out of joy, but if I saw a picture of one of these people, I'm sure it would look like sadness to me.<p>Further, I don't like the sound of a future where people stop talking to other people because a light starts blinking.<p>However, for the purposes of autism research and development, this is good. Better than good - this is excellent. I really hope there will be more research in this area, for the purpose of helping those who can't communicate well.

The HR folks were very friendly and I enjoyed the time that I spent with them.  At Google I'd have had some of the brightest coworkers anywhere, and that was pretty tempting. In my time at the GooglePlex I also got to experience the ample perks of working there.  I realized that these were probably the best benefits I could get if I chose to work for another company.<p>Still, it took me less than a split second to decide.  As a founder and a location-independent entrepreneur the loss of freedom and self-determination were unthinkable.  With my current setup, I can jump a flight to anywhere I want, for as long as I want without having to ask permission from anyone.  Likewise, my income and share of the profits I produce are determined by me alone.  I wouldn't trade that for anything.<p>I'm actually tremendously thankful for the opportunity that I had at Google because, as potentially the world's best place to be an employee, they helped crystalize for me the realization that I am in exactly the right place.",1309821499
