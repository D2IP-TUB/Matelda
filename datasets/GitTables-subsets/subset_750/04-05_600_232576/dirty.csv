8436304,comment,8435869,8436131,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Notch, for better or worse, was an idealistic symbol of anti-establishmentarianism, most famously when he declared that Mojang wouldn&#x27;t be developing Minecraft for Facebook after oculus sold out to them, even though the financial incentives were obviously greatly enhanced by such an acquisition, which was going to accelerate development of VR as a platform, particularly with Minecraft sitting right in the nexus of Social/Gaming.   He stood on principals, rather than align him self conceptually or monetarily with (what he perceived) to be Oculus selling out.<p>But, there comes a point, when everyone says, &quot;You know what - pay me enough money and you can do anything you want with my greatest creation.&quot;<p>Would Sartre have been willing use his voice, his writing, and his intellectual heft to support various bourgeois position for $2B, knowing that he could have used that money to support the &quot;concrete&quot; freedoms for so many people in so many places?  He was tortured by turning down 250,000 crowns (around $2mm in current dollars?)<p>Of course, the contrary position to this is that what Sartre did not want to sacrifice was his freedom to not be associated with any one political body, so that his writing would in no way be restrained by anything other than his intellect; and Notch, in selling Mojang to Microsoft, gave up none of his independence, and in no way became associated with Microsoft (indeed, he immediately left the company upon acquisition).

I feel like the comments are a bit too small.  Maybe have it so you could swipe a parent comment and it&#x27;ll fold the children?  The layout in general looks a bit awkward when there is a long chain of comments, but I&#x27;m not sure how that could be approached differently.<p>- It&#x27;d be awesome to have it so swiping back from the comments page / link would take you to the main screen.  It&#x27;d make browsing feel more smooth.<p>- Some sort of difference between read posts and unread posts would be a good idea, too.<p>- A night theme is pretty much a dealbreaker for me since I use my tablet most at night.  That&#x27;s just me being picky, though.<p>All in all, it feels pretty smooth, but feels more phone-oriented than tablet oriented due to everything being so small (comments, headers, etc.).

The first was written by James Gosling, ... I discovered that Gosling&#x27;s Emacs did not have a real Lisp. It had a programming language that was known as ‘mocklisp’, which looks syntactically like Lisp, but didn&#x27;t have the data structures of Lisp... I concluded I couldn&#x27;t use it [it here means mocklisp, but can be confused to mean Gosling Emacs] and had to replace it all, the first step of which was to write an actual Lisp interpreter. I gradually adapted every part of the editor based on real Lisp data structures, rather than ad hoc data structures, making the data structures of the internals of the editor exposable and manipulable by the user&#x27;s Lisp programs...This second Emacs program was ‘free software’ in the modern sense of the term&quot;<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m reading too much into it.",1412916015

8436276,comment,8430349,8435037,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I strongly agree with this. I&#x27;m being contrarian with my questions above (and may do so again in the future) becuase it seems to me that the big obstacles to a basic income are cultural and political, and I&#x27;m trying to figure out good solutions to that problem.<p>As a parallel, consider immigration. From an economic point of view, open borders make a lot of sense because the supply of labor can easily adjust to the demand, so I&#x27;ve wondered for a long time why there shouldn&#x27;t be free movement of labor as well as capital. Indeed, many people agree with this; I can&#x27;t imagine you&#x27;d find anyone in the US that wanted to adopt China&#x27;s <i>houkou</i> system, and require people from one state to get a work permit before moving to or taking a job in another state. Given the demographic situation in the US with waves of baby boomers retiring but also living longer the resultant worsening retiree:worker ratio, immigration also makes a great deal of sense as a way to keep a lid on payroll taxes and so forth, and this is coincidentally the last opportunity the US is likely to have to exploit a nearby foreign labor surplus just when it needs one (due to falling overseas birthrates and wage equalization eroding the US demand-side advantages).<p>Pretty much every economist agrees that more immigration with fewer restrictions would be a good thing for the US. But obviously a sizable contingent of the population just <i>cannot stand</i> that idea and any time such proposals are made in DC the objectors melt the congressional switchboard as quickly as possible to express their displeasure.<p>So I&#x27;ve given up hope that proposals for a basic income would succeed on the grounds of rationality alone.",1412915743

People get it into their heads that computers are hard/complicated/etc., and so they get scared of them, and so then they don&#x27;t do anything with them but a strict subset they&#x27;ve decided they understand and wind up doing all sorts of things wrong or inefficiently. Often, in trying to protect the computer and themselves from what they&#x27;ve convinced themselves they don&#x27;t understand, they wind up breaking it instead: they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing because they think they can&#x27;t learn. &quot;It&#x27;s too complicated.&quot;",1412914647

That&#x27;s not a problem for the airline, because the tickets got sold and it was the passengers fault. However, this is a failure for the tube, for which payment is secondary<p>In both cases, the airline and the tube have fixed costs related to having planes flying or trains running. For both of them payments are necessary to offset the fixed costs and generate profits to further invest in better transports.<p>They key difference is that for one the volume of passengers is much higher than the other, therefore &quot;full capacity&quot; is defined in very different terms in the Tube vs a plane.
