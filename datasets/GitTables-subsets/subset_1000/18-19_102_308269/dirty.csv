161978,comment,161867,161894,0,0,lnguyen,,,"Source control does matter.  If you're thinking about any serious development effort (startup or not), you really need to use it.  Unless of course you can honestly say that you always know exactly what your next step is, never make any mistakes, never need to go back to an old version and work with a group of identical equally perfect developers.<p>What you need to figure out is which tool (git, svn, or something completely different) matches with your style and needs as a developer or group of developers.  The best version control is the one that becomes part of your natural workflow so you use it without thinking of it as an extra step that you constantly have to do.  Because if that happens, you'll just stop using it.<p>Git's branching capabilities work well for someone who needs to work on multiple independent features or try out new ideas that may or may not work out.  All of which is usually what's going on in a startup.  It's something that comes as part of the tool instead of having to be worked up in a series of processes that you don't either have to time or (painful) experience to come up with yourself.",1208026719

There are many ways to ""explain the internet"" to someone with no knowledge of computers, but to explain how it is, or how it works, they must understand what a computer is.",1208026643

You just cannot have a totalitarian government and a society that is free to innovate and create new things<p>Another good example is Singapore. Sure you can walk alone at 3am and not even be in the slightest bit of danger... but with all the censorship you have graduate students who do not know how to have sex. This is not a joke - it was prominent problem 8 years ago. They just went around the problem by heavily promoting immigration",1208026478

161970,comment,161886,161933,0,0,flipbrad,,,"that's an easy comment to make that very much fits the zeitgeist, but some sort of cynicism is required. If we're wrong on this, and 'build it and the money will come' strategies fail, then we're definitely setting ourselves up for a boom+bust that's going to be painful for all.<p>The cynicism is that, in addition to suiting startups that haven't got the intellectual capital required to think about a sustainable business strategy as they head into business, it also very much suits YC's approach (see below), which might explain why, as a meme, it's so pervasive!<p>The YC-like approach could be caricatured as 'shotgun' - throw a load of startups at a wall (boost their launch) and see what sticks (in terms of adoption); but if the rest, which don't show immediate adoption, get neglected by YC-like investors-mentor hybrids too soon, they won't pick up the transferable business skills that would serve them for a lifetime. Putting your hands into a launch-focused incubator is risky, from the startup's perspective.<p>YC, as first on the scene, has many 'value-added' factors (mainly PR-based) that make this risk worth taking; but copycats don't deliver these (e.g. a great network, great reputation with potential series A investors, media rep, etc). In that light, copycats may actually be more beneficial to the startup scene if they alter their strategy relative to YC to deliver different value-addeds, as Seedcamp does. Probably not worth pooh-pooing them without thinking a bit further, just in case we are letting a damaging meme spread too far without challenge.<p>The key is to make sure both launch-drive and business training/mentorship are provided in equal amounts - the order in which they come can be debated, and is the nub of the seedcamp vs. YC debate; but let's make sure the complexity of what YC offers comes across - it's not just launch drive and that's not the only important thing in seed stage investment. Long term, that could be very damaging for YC copycats that don't have as clear an idea of what's needed",1208026148

161966,comment,161927,161927,0,0,ingenium,,,"I've switched from OS X to Ubuntu, and would never go back. I'm not really a developer, but I do some coding every now and then. Perhaps what I like most about Ubuntu is that I can customize it to fix all those little annoyances that I couldn't do anything about on OS X. It's also trivial to install programs thanks to a real package manager (Fink doesn't count in OS X). GNOME is also the only GUI I've found that lets you type the whole filename to jump to a file/folder rather than jumping to the filenames that start with the last letter you typed.<p>I suppose my biggest annoyance with OS X is that it doesn't let you actually have control. A perfect example is that I have SAMBA turned on in OS X to share some files to other computers on my network. For security, I have a separate user account for the share. I can't configure the shares and permissions in the GUI because it's not a ""simple"" setup, so I have to use the config file for samba. Every single OS update I get overwrites this file, so I have to re-create it every time. Furthermore, as of 10.5, permissions seem to just spontaneously change. I can no longer get group permissions to inherit.<p>Another time, I needed to quickly use TFTP. Trying to get this setup in OS X is a nightmare, and after spending a couple hours on it, I just gave up. It's installed and there, but it for some reason its configuration is just non-standard.<p>It's just these little things that make me glad I switched to Ubunutu, and I would never even consider using OS X again.",1208025801
161965,comment,161778,161915,0,0,sounddust,,,"But the problem is still the same.  The statement that ""people have an irrational sense of logic because they would take food from a roommate, but not money"" is still incorrect.<p>Of the 15 or so roommates I've had in my life, 13 or 14 would have almost always answered ""yes"" to the question ""hey, can I take XXX from the fridge and eat it.""  Whereas fewer of them would have answered the same if I had asked for money.   Therefore, the decision to take something from another person is heavily influenced by the anticipated response of that person (and therefore not as illogical as the researcher is concluding).",1208025625

If you've done a lot of business travel, it also (I hope) has some emotional resonance, because business air travel is an abusive experience.<p>I started following James Fallows after I heard him on NPR talking about ""Free Flight"", a book I recommend even though it wasn't particularly predictive. ""Free Flight"" is a book about the Cirrus SR-20 and the Eclipse E500; the former is a short-hop prop plane with advanced navigation and a whole-plane parachute, the second is an ultra-efficient jet the size of an SUV. Both are trying to establish an ""air taxi"" market for short-hop flights between underused airports.<p>I love the idea of being able to drive to a tiny airport, walk up to a counter, show my ID, go right out to a small waiting airplane, and being in the air 5 minutes later. That somewhat interesting software is being used to price the legs ($300-$1200 now, 1-2 orders of magnitude below charter, on par with business class or full-fare coach now) seems like a footnote.",1208024276
