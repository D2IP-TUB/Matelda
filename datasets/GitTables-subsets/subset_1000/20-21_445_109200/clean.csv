There is no evidence that most modern insecticides harm humans at all (some do but they are less commonly used, mostly only for specific classes of pest).  DDT for example had no deleterious effect on human health, until the environmentalist idiots got it banned and malaria started killing millions again in tropical regions.  The most dangerous insecticides were phased out long ago, first the arsenicals, then nicotine sulfate, both of which were very dangerous to people.<p>ETA: DDT was dusted directly on people for flea and lice control and typhus prevention and was primarily sprayed indoors for malaria prevention so there was a lot more direct human contact than even production plant workers have with insecticides currently.",1248901030

It's a share-and-share-alike system.<p>I've run into many people who are very opposed to the GPL, generally because they can't build upon GPL code without being required to release their code under a GPL license.  In general, I see these people as wanting a license to protect their ideas, but a license isn't designed for that.  A license protects work (by preventing what you can do with it, while the idea is often evident, documented, or easily derivable).  A patent protects ideas.  If your idea is so good it can stand on its own then you can patent it and release the code in whatever way you want because you can still prevent people from using your idea even if they can see your code.<p>Heck, if your code is so great that you should get all the royalties, then wouldn't you want everyone else to be able to see how awesome it is?",1248900964

I need as much food - now, as I can get, right?  Potato scab could seriously fuck me up.  Therefore GMO potatoes sure seem like a great idea to me - if they're immune to scab.<p>Before 'monocrops' were engineered, nations went to war over food because it was scarce.  Disease killed entire crops.  Since Borlaug bred disease resistant rice and wheat - war is down.  Way down.  We make enough food.<p>Except - to keep up with growing populations, we have to use GMO technology to increase our agricultural output.  Organic food is a first world nice to have.  GMO food is a whole world MUST have.<p>Here's two facts that may change your attitude - or at least make you question what you think you know.<p>1) The father of the monocrop, Norman Borlaug won the Nobel prize for saving a billion lives by increasing agricultural output enormously... and yet most people have never heard of him.  Bizarre, isn't it?<p>2) During the famine and widespread starvation in Africa in the 80s, Greenpeace successfully opposed the export of 'chemical' fertilizers from Europe to Africa.  They were banned.  Bizarre, isn't it?<p>The GMO fears are luddite.  There is widespread misinformation.  The FDA is incredibly strict here.",1248900784

For the price of a Segway it could be equipped with a motor of similar speed and efficiency, or it can be run on human power.  Unlike the Segway, the bicycle can go in the street and on dirt trails, has much greater maximum speed and range, and is cheap and easy to repair.<p>Sure, the Segway has advantages too - but when people suggest that it should go at 25mph in city streets, it's worth considering whether the Segway's unique properties actually contribute anything.  Different tools are better for different jobs.<p>I'm all in favor of thinking outside the box, but things like cargo bicycles are more practical and interesting (though less sexy and high-tech) for my own city transportation needs: <a href=""http://www.xtracycle.com/cargo-utility-bicycles.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xtracycle.com/cargo-utility-bicycles.html</a>",1248900758

731000,comment,730392,730854,0,0,jrockway,,,"The language doesn't really matter.  Here are the problems that C introduces, and how other languages have solved them:<p>Buffer overflows.  The solution is to not let the programmer (or attacker, when exploited) touch arbitrary memory.  All the ""managed"" environments do this.  (""But what if there's a bug in the implementation!?""  Well, fix that, and you've fixed all existing software and all future software.  Much better than checking every program for the same bug, for The Rest Of Eternity.)<p>Integer overflows.  The solution is a better type system.  Instead of overflowing, switch from the machine integer to a bigger integral type.  (Yup, you lose performance after the switchover, but that's better than letting an attacker take over your machine.  Optimize for speed after your program works correctly.)<p>Ignoring errors.  Many C programmers forget to check for errors, and then the program state is silently corrupted, leading to security problems, strange behavior, etc.  Exceptions solve this problem.<p>There are many other security problems, but these still keep cropping up even though we have tools that eliminate them.  So they are most annoying to me.  (Everyone has written ""allow_login if !$password->valid"", and I doubt new programming languages will fix that.  But there is no excuse for buffer or integer overflows these days.)<p>Writing application software in C is the classic example of premature optimization and the evil it brings.",1248900353

I'm not disputing in any way that plants have toxins or that we had to develop various practices to make us safer.  I don't dispute that many man-made chemicals are safe and useful.  I don't even dispute that pesticides could conceivably improve safety from a hypothetical insect-born contagion.<p>However genetically modified mono-crops sprayed with heavy loads of pesticides simply to increase yields does not strike me as something that goes towards food safety at all.  It goes towards short-term profit, and you can bet the cost of any long term health effects is simply ignored until 30-40 years down the line when the soil is depleted and the effects of various pesticides have time to show up in the human population.  At that point the industry will throw its hands up in the air and say ""how could we have known?"" while pushing the new and improved fertilizers and pesticides with a new batch of as-of-yet-unknown problems.<p>That's why I think it's a good idea to eat more traditionally raised food.

He certainly has my respect (for the work he did, that he got wealthy of it is secondary to me).<p>Anybody that would want to use a segway but doesn't because it makes them look smug has self confidence issues that the segway could never cure. If you need it and can afford it use it otherwise don't. Image doesn't enter in to the equation.<p>That's the same nonsense that top gear gets in to, cars for hairdressers and that sort of crap.",1248897643
