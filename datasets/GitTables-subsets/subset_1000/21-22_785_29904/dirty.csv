Remote wipe has been available for some time through different methods.<p>What is being done here is an ""enterprise"" type integration, that data put on the phone is kept track of and if the phone leaves a ""secure"" area, then the tagged data can be automatically wiped.<p>This enables some different models for wiping that might be more fluid then the ""nuke it from orbit"" option.  By tagging specific pieces of data as sensitive (and performing information flow analysis to track wherever that data gets propogated to), they can target the wiping to just the sensitive data.  So before you even realize a phone is stolen, it can be securely wiped.<p>Another interesting use case is to automatically wipe the sensitive data whenever leaving the workplace, or perhaps some radius around work.  That way, whenever you go on travel (or even just home for the day), the sensitive data is wiped, but say your contacts, personal email, and other app data could be retained, leaving it as a perfectly functional smartphone, without any of the company's data to lose.<p>Holes in their technique include simple attacks like turning the phone off (and pulling the SD card), but hopefully the sensitive data is also encrypted whenever it resides on disk.",1319405842

This takes some time...and good luck getting insurance coverage (the real factor in what you do/don't fly) if you don't have an instrument ticket.<p>Furthermore there's a world of difference between zero or a few minutes of instrument experience and three hours.  I don't have any study to back this up but I'm a pilot and can tell you from experience that the first time you go on full instruments it's sheer sensory overload.  Three hours doesn't prepare you to do a decoupled IFR approach or anything, but it give you enough to do a 180.<p>Here's another important factor about the study that never gets mentioned: in the study the attitude indicator (artificial horizon), heading indicator, and vertical speed indicator were covered, simulating a partial failure of the vacuum system as well as a partial failure of the pitot/static system.  No pilot is going to take off these instrument in failure, and should they fail in flight most pilots are getting down, <i>now.</i> I know I would be heading to the nearest field if I saw partial failure of both instrument systems.<p>So instead of saying ""VFR pilots are toast in 178 seconds if they go into clouds"" quotes should read more like, ""if you happen to be Dr Sam Beckett and you find you've quantum lept into a Bonanza that has partial instrument system failures and you've flown into a cloud, you better hope Al can jump your ass back out within three minutes.""",1319405358

That would help when looking for more out-of-the-way hidden gems for recommendations, but it doesn't help when trying to rate films I've seen to improve the quality of my circle.  I'd still suggest that you propose rating movies that polarize people heavily, as a partitioning technique.  This works both in the general case (show me movies that many people rated, but which get both very high and very low ratings frequently), and in the specific case based on the contents of your circle (help me rate movies that would differentiate me from members of my current circle, not just movies that would reinforce my circle).<p>As for 0.5 versus 0, fair enough; it just seemed a bit quirky. :)<p>> Regarding ""but now I don't see an obvious next step."", this sounds weird; you should normally have been redirected to a search result (a Circle) straight out of rating 5 movies, no more. Isn't that what happened?<p>Nope; I kept rating movies, until eventually all of the initial sets of films disappeared, and nothing else happened.<p>> There's no other ""I haven't seen this movie"" once you land your first search Circle, because there's no point. Either you haven't seen it and it stays as a recommendation (which you can add to your deegList), or you really don't want to see it and you can therefore Mute it with the ""-"" sign.<p>Fair enough.  However, I wonder: do you take ""mute"" into account when doing recommendations, or just hide films?  In particular, I see a number of films for which I could either rate them 0.5 (""I can tell from the trailer that this will suck"") or mute them (""I guess I should reserve judgement, but I don't ever want to see it"").<p>One more misplaced translation: ""Retour en haut"".",1319404450

There's no real reason to use a monospaced font at all here, but if you must go monospaced at least put Consolas in front.

I want Georgia 15! :-)<p>* The preview window text is awfully small on a high-density monitor like my ThinkPad W510's 145 pixel per inch display. I see how to edit the CSS to make the text bigger (although in a quick test it didn't seem to work at all - will fiddle with it some more) - but with every element sized in px it's a bit of a pain to just make everything bigger. Maybe size everything in percents and just have an overall px size on the body, or some similar technique? Then I could just change one number and make everything bigger.",1319404069

We concentrate on big ticket items such homes and wheels. We allow an individual user to 'Make a Demand' to rent a home. Once enough users are interested, we contact landlord that own buildings and ask them for the best price for a group (min. 3). Landlords have been willing to give at minimum 15% discount up until now.<p>I would like to discuss how we could automate the process to ensure that we don;t have to spend a huge amount of time always going back and forth with the landlord. Also, how could we decrease the time to form the group and then list a deal for the group?",1319403913

Also we think it's more disgraceful to get a 0.5 than a 0. And other reasons.<p>Regarding ""but now I don't see an obvious next step."", this sounds weird; you should normally have been redirected to a search result (a Circle) straight out of rating 5 movies, no more. Isn't that what happened?<p>There's no other ""I haven't seen this movie"" once you land your first search Circle, because there's no point. Either you haven't seen it and it stays as a recommendation (which you can add to your deegList), or you really don't want to see it and you can therefore Mute it with the ""-"" sign.<p>Yep, deegr, derived from digging. It's quick, catchy, simple, easy to type and to say... And it was available :/",1319403683
