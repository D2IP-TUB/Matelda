It's like peanut butter and chocolate!</p> <p>Streaming analytics is a superset of complex event processing, with clustered runtimes to support greater volume of events, ability to analyze unstructured data and more expressive programming paradigms. And very low latency to enable real time analytic processing.</p> <p>Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.</p> <p>This Meetup will provide an overview and comparison of many different contenders in the fast growing streaming analytics space, then show a demo of IBM Streams technology allowing programs written completely in Python to call Streams libraries, and then deploy those apps to the Streams runtime.</p> <p>Pizza and drinks will be served.</p> ","10800000","1470709415000","20295369","open","42.36000061035156","-71.06999969482422","Boston Analytics Meetup","Boston-Analytics-Meetup","Members","","233644738","https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Analytics-Meetup/events/233644738/","","Streaming Analytics with Python","","","","past","1472594400000","1472606947000","-14400000","1 Rogers Street","","Cambridge","us","23817440","42.3664665222168","USA","-71.07735443115234","IBM Client Center","","False","MA","","public","0","12"
