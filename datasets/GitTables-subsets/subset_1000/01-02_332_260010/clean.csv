Meanwhile, the market for console games, which have a much higher barrier to entry to pirate, is booming:<p><a href=""http://origin.arstechnica.com/news.media/video-game-sales-1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://origin.arstechnica.com/news.media/video-game-sales-1....</a><p>Rightly or not, PC game makers have it in their heads that piracy is killing their business. I can see it both ways: On one hand, I find it hard to believe that not even a small fraction of computer game pirates would purchase more games if they couldn't easily steal them. But I also wonder if declining PC sales aren't just a byproduct of the ""serious"" gamers' shift towards preferring console games.<p>Regardless, the market for PC game sales has flatlined, and Ubisoft is trying desperately to jumpstart it by enacting a system that makes piracy <i>significantly</i> more difficult, at least for a little while. I'm sure they'll use the 3-4 months of nearly-zero piracy rates as a yardstick with which to measure the potential of the industry <i>sans</i> piracy.

Check with a good lawyer to discuss in detail.<p>Though the details you give are sketchy, what I read between the lines is this: this guy has a nice little cash stream going from this; you might threaten it with a superior offering; he can't possibly beat you competitively; ergo, he will try to position things to try force you to let him grab your superior site for his own benefit or else face the alternative of having to pay many thousands in legal fees to defend against his claims. That is what I mainly infer from the claim that you supposedly violated his rights by allegedly misappropriating his ""idea"" (this sounds frivolous on its face, as most ideas that are out in public are not protectable unless they are connected with an enforceable patent). Why do I infer this? Because, if he succeeds in causing you to cave, the normal remedy for resolving the theft of an idea is for you to assign over to him the fruit of your work embodying that idea (that is, your site).<p>I know this sounds awful and it may not be true (again, I don't know any details). But all the surface indicators would seem to point that way. If this is the true picture, then your strategy will likely be to figure out a way to persevere in spite of the legal harassment until you gain commercial viability as an enterprise. You need to explore such issues in detail with your lawyer. The good news is that there probably is a workable path for you on this if the claims lack merit - it is one thing to be hit with a legal claim that exposes you to true substantial liabilities but quite another to have to fend off one that is lacking in merit (usually much, much easier to deal with the latter because the big threat lies solely in its nuisance value).",1267234829

1154650,comment,1150631,1151947,0,0,gchpaco,,,"That's a very large question, but I'll take a stab at a quick summary.<p>- All resources in Plan 9 are accessed through the file system.  Want to get a screenshot?  Read from /dev/window.  Want to get access a file on a machine halfway around the world?  Mount it on your file system.  Want to interrogate the kernel, or change things?  /proc.  (this last bit has been ported to Linux and other Unixes; only greybeards tend to remember the days when ps had to be setuid root)<p>- (almost) all resources are textual.  None of this business of sending obscure bits to ioctl; if you want your connection to be a certain baud, you open the appropriate ""file"" and tell it so.<p>- Related: none of this connect, bind, nonsense.  You want network sockets?  Open stuff in /net.<p>- There is no one single ""file system"", unlike in Unix.  When you are running in a 9term, /dev/cons is the console.  When you are typing in a different 9term, it's still reading from /dev/cons but it's a different /dev/cons.  It's possible for every program on the system to have a completely different view of the filesystem (although I doubt it's really sensible).  Accordingly there's no superuser; there's only ""permission to access X"".<p>- Union mount points.  There's no /bin, /usr/bin, $HOME/bin, etc; everything is always in /bin.  The system automatically makes /bin contain the executables that are most appropriate fro your processor; rc is always /bin/rc but on one machine it's MIPS code and on another it's x86 code.<p>- A resulting truly distributed system.  Typical use had you logging in from a network terminal (like an X terminal) and running jobs on a CPU server mostly transparently, there's disk servers you can mount, etc.  I'm not 100% sure how this part works, because I've never been able to run it in the wild.<p>- Plan 9 was designed with the intent of GUI stuff from the get go.  There's no curses stuff, no console libraries; if you want to do that stuff, you use a GUI.  But these GUIs were designed by folks who were very comfortable with using a command line, and so one ends up with huge amounts of text on screen that you interact with (the history mechanism for rc actually looks at the window buffer for the terminal it is running in, looking for prompts).  There's an input language for mice, that's most obvious in acme (where cut and paste are done by mouse button chords).<p>- As a result of this most of userland has been worked over, probably because somebody was forced to think seriously of reimplementing the Bourne shell.  rc is remarkably minimal for a login shell in this day of zsh, and seems useless in an xterm; but because in a 9term you can edit previous output and previous command lines and tell the terminal not to send input at the end of a line but instead wait for you to decide you're finished it ends up being surprisingly powerful and usable.  It's hard to get this in Unix because a lot of the tricks they did with it involve accessing the textual representation of the contents of the 9term and e.g. grepping over it or the like.  Plan 9 from User Space does manage it and it's a very strange experience.<p>- Unicode throughout, which doesn't seem like such a big deal now but was pretty significant back in 1992.<p>- A bunch of fascinating programs written as a general solution to specific frustrations.  Modern terminal replacements sometimes highlight URLs or the like; the Plan 9 plumber would do this with anything, and was consistently implemented across the system (Button 3 in recent acmes, for example, runs the plumber and only does local search if that fails to match).<p>Plan 9 can be very disturbing to work with at first; everything seems incredibly primitive, and it has a very minimalist feel to it, but when you get used to the idioms it can be incredibly powerful.  It's a pity they never wrote a real web browser for it, I would love to see what it would look like.  The whole experience is very strange, and yet there's a certain elegance to it.",1267232828
