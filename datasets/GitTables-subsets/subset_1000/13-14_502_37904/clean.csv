It identifies a few factors as being better predictors of happiness in later life, not just having say factor #1 or #3 but a combination of them simultaneously, the more--of course--the better.<p>It does seem to put more weight on how we deal with adversity as being probably more important, having a range of ""strategies"" from the more immature to the more advanced, which suggests that they are learned or one can eventually make the leap to the better ways. Also it mentions how physical health as a young adult is a better predictor of mental health later in life, but not so much of physical health.

605316,comment,605146,605278,0,0,rjprins,,,"Okay, you have two conflicting criteria: Spreading load and minimizing VM movements:<p>Algorithm A: Always choose the server with the most slots free spreads the load most equally without moving VM's.\n(Assuming servers are equal in capacity. Minimizing load-balance is defined as minimizing the difference between highest loaded server and lowest loaded server.)<p>Proof: Given a VM to be placed, v, and a set of servers S of which server s' is has most slots free. \nSay picking s' to place v does not give the most optimal load-balance. Then there must be server with with more slots free then s', contradiction.<p>Algorithm B: Let S be a series of servers ordered by load (lowest number of free slots first). Put a new VM v on the first server s, on which v fits. This maximizes the initial number of VM's you can place without moving VM's, without prior knowledge.<p>Proof: Because we always try to fit each VM in the first server possible, we maximize the amount of consecutive space on the last server. Thus, without prior knowledge, this maximizes the number of VM's we can place.<p>I take it you like neither of these solutions. You want to compromise between the two solutions. Doing that right (there is not optimal in that sense) would depend on the scale difference between servers slots and space required by VM's. If VM's are small and servers big, you can safely go for load balance. If VM's are big and servers relatively small, you may go for B.",1242134799

However, C++ programmers spend a fair amount of time worrying about/writing code for memory cleanup and destructors is where a lot of that time/code goes.<p>Folks using languages with GC don't do that nearly as much.<p>Destructructors are only implied for scope-allocated variables.  By tying value lifetime to variable scope, C++ gets to do certain things, but as a result, programmers have to do certain work.<p>Lisp values are not tied to variable scope, so complaining that lisp doesn't have mechanisms for values that are tied to scope is sort of like complaining that a hovercraft doesn't have a parking brake.<p>> C++ destructors are a powerful tool, you can create data types that otherwise would require support on the compiler's side.<p>Actually, they're just a mechanism for calling code when a value ""goes away"".
