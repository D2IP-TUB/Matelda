And, unlike software patents, they are more likely to represent a significant R&D investment by the applicant.<p>(I am the author of the paper that showed how much of the human genome is patented.

The current law states that DNA (or any other naturally occurring chemical) cannot be patented unless it is significantly transformed from it's natural state.  However, purification of the DNA is usually enough to render it patentable.   That, of course, is not difficult with current molecular biology techniques.<p>But, like any other technology, patent applications covering DNA must meet many other requirements including non-obviousness and usefulness. Thus, the claims granted by the USPTO have become increasingly narrow as the field has matured and there is more prior art.  That is, just like any new technology area the initially granted patents are broad, but they narrow over time.<p>So, that is a long way of saying, this might be a tempest in a teapot.

The precomputed hashes are generated with a specific character set. This works particularly well for unsalted algorithms that support limited character sets such as LM. LM splits the password into two on the 7 character boundary, capitalises it and only supports a subset of printable characters. Also it's unsalted, so while more computationally expensive than NTLM it's actually easier to crack. Rainbow tables for LM can be downloaded from freerainbowtables.net and are about 30-40Gb.<p>NTLM on the other hand supports unicode and very long password lengths. Most rainbow tables are mixalpha, or alphanumeric but short length. Our mixalphanum with symbols rainbow table set goes up to 14 characters and is about just under a terabyte. This is more difficult to put on SSDs cheaply.<p>Your best bet to protecting from rainbow tables is to use a  character not referenced in commonly available sets in your password as you inevitably otherwise reach the limits of security vs usability with exceptionally long characters. As I use british keyboards, I generally recommend the Â£ symbol (British pound) or accent over a vowel. The Euro symbol is also good if you're staying in Europe.",1288434568

If they are running JavaScript in your DOM you are already hosed, they can grab any token you put in your form.  There is no sane reason for having ACTION change via request parameters: you would have bigger issues than session stealing.  And in any other situation, you should be protected by the browser's cross domain restrictions.  I don't understand what you are suggesting.",1288433001

It is the GPL that has a problem with the App Store.  Considering that there is plenty of software on the store using other open licenses, such as BSD and LGPL, and putting it together with Apple's willingness to allow GPL'd software(VLC) on the App Store, it is clear that the party causing VLC to be pulled is in fact the copyright holder and no-one else.  Claims of ""But, but, he made me do it!"" are every bit as immature as they sound.",1288432999

Is it because it has no ""download source"" button? You can get it easily enough at the dev's site...",1288432979
