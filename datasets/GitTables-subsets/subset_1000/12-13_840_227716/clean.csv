I'm guessing you're making that claim based on David's discoveries on the old (2.x) GIL last year and didn't actually bother seeing the presentations (or reading the slides, or the blog posts). All the issues he outlined are in multithreaded workloads (why would the GIL do anything for single-threaded loads?). His original outline (the one which basically went viral) was about ""GIL battles"" (GIL contention) in the old GIL [0], and GIL contention happens when the OS schedules two Python threads for running simultaneously and they both try to run at the same time. How do you do that without running two Python threads simultaneously?<p>Later, David also exposed a convoy effect with IO-bound threads in the new (Python 3.2) GIL [1] [2]<p>See also his Interactive Python Thread Visualizations [3] and note that <i>all</i> of them involve at least 2 threads.<p>[0] <a href=""http://dabeaz.blogspot.com/2010/01/python-gil-visualized.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dabeaz.blogspot.com/2010/01/python-gil-visualized.htm...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://bugs.python.org/issue7946"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bugs.python.org/issue7946</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://dabeaz.blogspot.com/2010/02/revisiting-thread-priorities-and-new.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dabeaz.blogspot.com/2010/02/revisiting-thread-priorit...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.dabeaz.com/GIL/gilvis/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dabeaz.com/GIL/gilvis/index.html</a>",1293540422

2045319,comment,2045088,2045197,0,0,dagw,,,"Well I'm mainly a python programmer and a fan of the language (but refuse to use the word ""pythonista"" and believe that whoever coined that word deserves a punch in the face) so take what I say with an appropriate grain of salt.<p>Yes python has a few warts you need to aware, and when you list then they sound quite overwhelming, but having programmed in python for, on and off, 10 years, very few of them have actually tripped me up in any serious way.<p>The GIL for example gets talked about more than it actually causes problems (and there are python implementations that don't have the GIL if it is truly a problem).  If I really need multiprocessing within python, the multiprocessing library normally solves my problem.<p>The string formatting ""problem"" you link to is hardly a problem at all in python 2.  The\n  ""%s"" % (foo) \napproach didn't stopped working after 2.4.  They simply added a way to deal with non-positional arguments.  That being said I'm not really a fan of the new python3 print syntax, but maybe I'll eventually get used to it.<p>as for the 2.x/3.x thing, yea I'll agree it's sub-optimal.  Let's just say I still write all my python code using 2.x since most of the libraries I use still don't have stable (or any) 3.x versions.<p>The version issue you link to is problem of forwards compatibility rather than backwards compatibility and many languages fail at forwards compatibility.  As far as I know there has only been one backwards compatibility break in python2, and that was that 'with' became a keyword.<p>Some syntax inconsistency is annoying I agree, but they're mostly there for backwards compatibility, and many have already been fixed.  Hopefully they've gotten it mostly cleaned up in python 3.<p>The other issues you link to seem to be mix of personal opinion and minor annoyances.<p>Sure the scope rules are a bit odd a times, but I've never really had problems with them in actual real code.<p>I really don't get the complaint about lack of information hiding.  Yes python doesn't have ""real"" information hiding, but you can get most of the useful parts of information hiding by adding underscore to start of your variables and method names.<p>The only point on that list that I actually agree with to any extent, is the lambdas/anonymous functions, complaint.  But again, it is a minor annoyance rather than a major deal breaker.<p>At the end of the day, I agree that there are a lot of odd corners in Python that have arisen from how the language has grown organically over the years, and yes there are 'cleaner' languages out there (although I'm not sure Ruby is one of them).  But for when it comes to getting things done in a quick, clean and efficient manner, python just works for me.",1293540381

2045304,comment,2045088,2045088,0,0,cturner,,,"I think classical-inheritance subclassing is itself harmful. Subclassing creates less flexible software than other approaches, and creates a need for lots of boilerplate.<p>This issue - super in python - drives many new python programmers crazy. However, I suspect most seasoned devs never think about it.<p>These days I never subclass or feel like I want to. Occasionally I'll use 'duck' typing where I would have subclassed in the past but I find that I rarely even need that. The desire to use classes like this sets off an alarm in my head that I'm making my code too complicated.<p>You do a lot of subclassing in Java. Java steers you there because it's so onerous to use dictionaries and arrays/lists/tuples. The syntax for these structures is simpler in python, and so they're more commonly-used.<p>Subclassing is particularly important for creating frameworks in java. You build your world with packages, class hierarchies and 'bean' style objects. Whereas in python you tend to abstract by module - sets of statics, functions and lightweight structures.<p>I believe python would be stronger still had it had removed subclassing altogether, and instead taken the prototype approach. In prototype languages there's no such thing as a class. Everything is cloned off an original master object. Functions and properties are tapped into the clone. Iolanguage has many of these advantages but is far slower, lacks the reach of python's standard library and (I think) also lacks python's awesome list-comprehension syntax.<p>Someone with better articulation than me could generate blog traffic for themselves by creating a pithy post about the difference in style between java and python, and why subclassing is unpythonic.

Barring significant engineering effort, the GIL is definitely more efficient than more fine-grained locking <i>in a single-threaded situation</i>. Which the Python core team considers of prime importance and the main use-case for Python (whether you agree or not is a different issue): previous tentatives to break-up the GIL lead to performance hits considered unacceptable (~20% across the board I believe).<p>It also tends to keep Python code less complicated as — much as with Javascript — you can not have two threads of Python code running at the exact same time within a process (this, on the other hand, is a very mixed blessing: it prevents people from learning about the brokenness of thread-based concurrency, and it generally breaks code migrated on a GIL-less implementation such as Jython or IronPython)",1293538700

Though the little twist about it at the end is a new (and quite despicable) addition to it.<p>>  it seems to me that this just adds to the list of Python issues<p>Considering this page is at least two years old, it's older than e.g. most of the GIL hubbub.<p>> The ongoing saga with the GIL (although I realize this has advantages in simplifying C extension development)<p>The GIL saga makes the whole language simpler (running directly opposite your thesis that all these ""points"" make the language more complex), though it <i>does</i> make taking advantage of multiple cores harder (if you somehow have a beef against multiple processes).<p>> String formatting changing seemingly from 2.4 and every version thereafter<p>You might want to read and test things before that kind of claims. When the article you link says:<p>> In Python 2.5 and later, there's a new formatter<p>it means the old one is still there. It was not removed in Python 2.5 (or later, `""It is %s!"" % foo` still works perfectly in Python 3.1). The second ""point"" of your article is hellishly disingenuous as it has <i>nothing</i> to do with formatting. It's also a pretty terrible article as it uses ""long form"" formatting in the `format` calls (which are used to make bindings clearer, whereas you can use C#-style positional formatting if your strings are short and readable in and of themselves)… and then whines that the formatting calls are too verbose.<p>And of course, coming from Perl the article you link to suggests… implicitly pulling variables out of the context instead of explicitly sending them to formatting.<p>> The 2.x/3.x split (yes I know there are reasons)<p>Indeed, and a number of these reasons center around making the language simpler and more consistent (`print` as a function, reorganization of the stdlib, ...).<p>> Version issues for scripting [2]<p>This has <i>nothing</i> to do with Python as a language.<p>> Syntax inconsistency. I know this one will be controversial but I'm referring to things like the fact that del() is a operation<p>What are you talking about? What is `del()`? Are you talking about `del` as in `del foo` and expressing your dislike of it being a statement? Considering the original job of `del` (completely remove a binding from a scope), I'm not sure what else it could have been (though I can't say I like it much, be it to remove a binding from a scope or remove elements from structures). I'd also enjoy your explanation of how it demonstrates inconsistency: which other Python non-statement operation is able to destructively alter scopes? And is a majority of the scope-altering operation non-statements? If it is not, would not the non-statement scope-altering operations be inconsistent?<p>> Other issues [3]<p>Few of these are universally valid. In fact, I can find none that is apart from whitespace making it harder (if not impossible) to generate code[0]. Some of these complaints are plain nonsensical (Python being an ""untyped language""), most others are personal preferences which you may or may not agree with (Python's scope confusion and crappy lambdas — or more precisely overuse of statements as Haskell's lambdas have exactly the same limitation — bug me a log, while TFAA's dislike of `eval` basically amounts to ""I hate languages where not everything is decided at compile time)<p>> Isn't something like Ruby or Lua a lot cleaner in this regard?<p>Ruby definitely is not, though the choices it made are most definitely different. I don't know enough Lua to comment on it.<p>But if you want orthogonal and consistent languages, you probably should not look at even remotely popular languages anyway: they're mostly hobbled together. Even Haskell, which your [3] seems to hold as some kind of holy grail, is a complex and not necessarily consistent language. Consistent languages are generally very small (syntax-wise, as every syntactic construct you add to the language exponentially increases your chances of breaking syntactic consistency) and provide lots of power to users (e.g. the ability to very easily define control-flow structures, increasing the risk of lowering the ""external"" consistency of produced code). Examples of such languages are Smalltalk, Forth, Lisp (especially, in my opinion, the Lisp-1 family). Though really all of those should be pluralized as they pretty systematically ended up forking from a common ancestor into a multitude of related-but-incompatible (usually library-wise, sometimes syntax-wise or semantics-wise) languages.<p>[0] but then again, how often does that happen, and doesn't Python provide the tools to generate a running system rather than have to statically generate code which will then have to be compiled and run? I can't say I've often liked <i>this kind</i> code generation, which in my experience has more often lead to pain and suffering than enjoyment, e.g. in GUI toolkits)",1293538143
2045264,comment,2045120,2045120,0,0,agl,,,"(I rather suspect that Mr Shaw is trolling, but anyway.)<p>It's certainly true that humans have all manner of interesting behaviors owing to the fact that we're smart apes with huge numbers of survival heuristics. I would pause before taking a sandwich from Hitler, because I'm human, but it's not pertinent to the question of whether the sandwich is any good. (Except in as far as you think it more or less likely that the sandwich is poisoned etc.)<p>So I find the whole first half of the text to be a flabby way of saying that the arguments of dishonest people need to be evaluated more critically than those of honest people. But I find that the arguments of honest people need to be critically evaluated too. I think that the authors of Haystack were honest, but their assertions turned out to be dangerously wrong. (Which, by the way, we know thanks to Mr Appelbaum.) So, as a guide, the motives of the author don't seem to be very useful to me.<p>Then, in the second half, we find a mixture of arguments that I find valid, and many that I don't. A sense of vertigo at the amount of trust that we have to put into software is justified. It is possible to hide major bugs in code and we're standing on a stack of hardware, kernel, and userland which is incomprehensible to any one person these days.<p>It's also true that there are some fairly effective attacks against Tor for the capable opponent. It's a real-time mix-net, with all the tradeoffs implied and it generates a lot of research. I recommend reading some papers of the papers, I find them often to be very good.<p>But accusing the Tor people of being NSA agents because they once got funding from the navy doesn't hold water. The Internet was an ARPA funded project. Military spending has subsidised much of the modern world.<p>Many people have read through Tor's source and evaluated the protocol etc. Of course, all those people could be NSA agents too, publishing fake papers. You could, in fact, be in The Matrix. But you probably aren't.<p>Some, likely massively exaggerated, secret project might be monitoring every ISP on the planet and thus able to break any real-time mix net, but they probably aren't.<p>Likewise, all the Tor node operators that I have met might all be NSA plants, but they probably aren't.<p>And finally the author picks out Mr Appelbaum for special criticism because he connects him with Wikileaks. I think his assertion that the goals of Tor and Wikileaks are in conflict is wrong, but we could go around all day trying to pin down the goals of Wikileaks so that's probably not fruitful. But it does seem ironic that the author voices support for Wikileaks right after asserting that such supporters are not to be trusted.<p>So, while the stack of software is, indeed, large, Tor remains a reasonable tool to use. If the author is so concerned with the human aspect, the Tor authors are make regular appearances at conferences and are wonderful people to meet. So do, and are, node operators in my experience.<p>Also, on top of Tor, there's a fair chance that the author is using a browser who's network and SSL stack I've had a hand in. And who knows what kind of person he's taking a sandwich from now?",1293538105
