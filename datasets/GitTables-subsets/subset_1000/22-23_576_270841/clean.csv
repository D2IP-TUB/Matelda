Allsopp understands Gruber's argument to be as such: Native apps are better because they are written in native languages that use native APIs.<p>I read Gruber's article and Allsopp is so far off the mark it's not even funny.<p>As someone who write web apps for mobile devices and desktop applications, I know that every time we are prototyping a web app and we need more X, then more X is available by going native. want some examples?<p>speed (are you doing graphics? is there a network peak?)\nintegration (can you tie other services to your devices?)\ncomputation load (video editing? on the web? for 5 simultaneous users? BANANAS!)\naccessibility (does your web app work offline? wah wah.)\nhardware (can you extend the usability physically?)<p>it's like people forget what ""closer to the metal"" means and have problems admitting to them selves that the web will never be cutting edge.<p>sure it's harder, and takes more time, but that's the price you have to weigh your decisions against.

Yes,it's beautiful, and if you know the muni public transportation system you can get around easily without a car, but rents can be high (like $1300 for a studio apartment that isn't scummy).

""Windows is a big turn off.""<p>Then I realized that most couples who met on the internet, much like all other couples: They end up fighting about money, trust, shared responsibility, etc. And, in all likelihood, they separate.

PHP doesn't magically absolve you of that.<p>It really has nothing to do with PHP, C, Ruby or [insert your most reviled/loved technology here]. Calling a complex runtime for hundreds of near-contentless requests per second on a single machine is a really bad idea, no matter what environment you use.<p>Also, I'm sorry if I snipe from the cheap seat here, but 1 request per second per user doesn't seem like a great solution to your problem either.

1824478,comment,1822126,1824151,0,0,reduxredacted,,,"<i>I think people often pre-judge others on their typing ability like some judge the intelligence</i><p>You're likely correct, and I've found myself doing this with some of my coworkers, however, over time I've come to understand it for what it is: There are many occasions in coding where I do not find it necessary to type quickly.  I can type at the speed a typical person speaks -- and accurately -- and without effort (including symbols, numbers and other elements that are uncommon in spoken language but common in programming languages).  I have never met an effective developer who is a ""hunt and peck"" typist, but I've met plenty that land in around 30 wpm.<p>The distinction, I think, lies in how much effort it takes our 30 wpm individual to produce 30 wpm.  Touch-typing (which I define as being able to type without looking at or for the key you're looking to hit) means not having to actively ""think"" when I type.  I know where the keys are by instinct/muscle memory.  I can keep my eyes on the screen, or on my hand-written ""napkin note"", or on my white-board (and often a mix of the three) and transfer that information to implementation without perceivable interruption.<p>Like it or not, the keyboard is a bit of a tool of the trade.  That doesn't mean you have to be a perfect typist (I don't use my pinkies to hit the letter ""p"", and until I purchased a split keyboard, I always reached with my left for the ""y""), but a reasonable analogy would be one of a chef who can't properly handle a knife.  Successful chefs don't always cut the way you're taught at the CIA (or wherever), but they handle the knife with precision and accuracy (and without effort or injury).  They don't have to think about it, they just know what the finished ingredient is going to look like when their hands are done with the motions.<p><i>For example someone with a slow southern draw to their speech, relative to the listener, is often assumed less intelligent.</i><p>I couldn't resist responding to this one: I remember having a calculus teacher with a serious Southern drawl and I recall thinking he was very unintelligent.  It was an error in judgment because I could barely understand him in a lecture setting and struggled in his class as a result (this was remedied by taking advantage of office hours and tutors).  After a while I got used to it and it had a sort of accidental side-effect.  I had to actively listen to understand him which resulted in my actively paying attention.  He was a brilliant individual, and a gifted instructor (as well as a patient one ... willing to explain things one-on-one with a student (me) who was struggling at the time).  Maybe teaching with a serious southern drawl in a northern state made him less effective, or maybe not.  I'm not sure.  Food for thought.",1287871574

I mean you may not like it, but it is very powerful, and a lot of languages are based on this principle (not just python and ruby).<p>The argument that there are hundreds of bugs because of it does not mean anything - you make the wrong assumption that everyhing else is equal. Of course, if dynamic typing was only about not checking types, it would be dumb. But it also gives you flexibility and avoids a lot whole lot of other kind of bugs, so you are trading one kind of bugs with another kind. For me, complaining about dynamic typing is like saying that exception cause a lot of bugs compared to error codes, because your application crashes if you don't catch exception. It is true in some sense, but the argument is rather stupid.<p>As for memory consumption: running an application in 64 bits, even if programmed in C, often requires much more memory, at least statistically speaking and in my experience. For example, running a simple ubuntu desktop in 64 bits takes easily 50 % more memory than in 32 bits (and it is not because of python :) ).
