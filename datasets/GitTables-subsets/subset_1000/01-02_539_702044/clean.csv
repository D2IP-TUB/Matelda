I am saving for retirement, but I can't do that without work.<p><i>> which is why I'd like to stop the inflationary bubble policy</i><p>The current monetary policy of all the Western governments is inflation targeting (with the exception of the US, which uses a triple mandate, of which inflation targeting is the most important part). The intention of inflation targeting is to act as an anti-cyclical force in the naturally pro-cyclical credit markets. Left to their own devices, financial institutions would increase credit levels in good times and decrease them in bad times, producing a succession of bubbles and busts. Monetary policy acts against this by pushing up interest rates when it believes there is too much credit and pushing them down when there is too little. It's barometer of whether credit levels are too high or too low is some chosen measure of consumer inflation. In this way, monetary policy reduces the inherently boom/bust nature of financial markets.<p>There is no 'inflationary bubble policy'. The markets themselves have an inherent tendency towards bubbles. They have existed since the beginning of modern financial markets, long before the current monetary policies were put in place. The claim that central banks inadvertently caused the dot com crash, or other bubbles, is a hotly contested subject in economics. It is not at all certain that it's true, and in any case is something that requires years of study and masses of evidence to resolve. What is certain, however, is that there is no policy of producing bubbles or inflation. The policy is to prevent it. In terms of stabilising consumer prices, inflation targeting has been one of the most successful monetary policies in all history, and the economic growth that has been part of the Great Moderation has lifted millions of people across the world out of poverty. In fact, more people have been lifted out of poverty under inflation targeting than under any other period of stability in history.<p><i>> Well if you've got a problem with the ""forcing"", then how about just government subsidies of 5x salary to those who work 16 hours a day? </i><p>How would they pay for it? Presumably by allocating resources from elsewhere, producing no net benefit.<p><i>> Flooding the market with cheap money is the same kind of manipulation</i><p>Central banks do not flood the market with cheap money. Inflation targeting is a policy whereby the market determines the quantity of money in the economy, and the central bank sets interest rates to encourage or choke off demand for credit. The result is stable consumer prices, at which the central banks have been uncannily successful.<p><i>> there most certainly is a parasitic economy that receives all of the newly introduced money first</i><p>Money is created through bank loans. The banks and the government do not receive the money first. The person who borrows is the first recipient. If the total amount of credit in a day grows, then the central bank will have to increase the quantity of base money through the purchase of bonds. If it shrinks, then it will sell bonds to reduce the quantity. The first people to see this money are therefore people who trade in the bond market, not banks and not governments. As far as I am aware, there is no evidence that bond traders profit unduly from this. The central bank simply operates as another trader in the market.<p><i>> Furthermore, the wealthy are able to hire ""asset managers"" to help them avoid the inflation, while the little guys have their savings eroded.</i><p>This is one of the many reasons why inflation is a bad thing. I agree that inflation is bad. That's why I support inflation targeting. Its <i>raison d'être</i> is to prevent inflation and deflation. It is incredibly good at it.<p><i>> To maintain a stable price index while technologically influenced goods are dropping requires everything else to go up.</i><p>If the quantity and demand for money and the number of products on the market were fixed, then the decrease in the nominal price of one good would necessarily cause an increase in the nominal price of others. Even if every good were being produced at lower real cost (i.e. with less labour, material and capital input) the 'average' nominal cost of products would stay the same. So you are right, the price of other goods has to go up. That's not a consequence of inflation targeting, but a standard economic result about nominal prices.",1232761691

One of the causes I've been able to gather is that they spent a large part of their growing years being told how things are and to accept that as sufficient evidence, but not having what is asserted jive with their own impressions. Enough of that, if they don't rebel they develop the sense that their own impressions and intuitions are completely flawed, and should never be trusted without someone else to tell how things are.<p>I'm not saying that you are wrong to enforce a no swearing policy with your kids -- that's an entirely different discussion that you have already said you don't want, so I won't push for it.
