Prop F is much more objective and substantive about what constitutes a violation than your typical HOA covenant: illegal hosting. Neighbors and their legal teams are unlikely to sue over that unless they think they can really prove a violation.",1443257996

I&#x27;ve always wondered if it&#x27;s possible to learn understanding this better. I&#x27;d like to think that most things can be learned and improved on at least to some degree so it might be worthwhile to investigate this.<p>I used to play online poker for a living and I feel it improved my intuitive understanding of limited chance events quite a bit (and taught me to think a lot more in expected value than in actual results which is very valuable imo). My hypothesis would be that a pool of (good) poker players understand something like every day variance better than a comparable sample with no poker background. There&#x27;s some counter evidence that may be related (econ students routinely know very little about basic econ concepts) but these examples tend to be about theoretical and not practical knowledge.\nNot sure what other groups one could include, statisticians or people who use statistics regularly (data scientists, data centric QM, investment bankers maybe)\nConstructing an instrument (questionnaire?) to measure intuitive understanding of statistics is probably non-trivial.<p>+I&#x27;m already having nightmares of endless Frequentist vs. Bayesian debates.<p>Afterwards, the interesting thing would be to construct creative (I&#x27;m thinking games due to my background but it could be anything) learning environments where an improved understanding of (hyper)exponential growth is developed.",1443257906

10282576,comment,10279961,10282286,0,0,jallmann,,,">  I was hoping h.323 might work well for a personal call system with the option of ditching regular cell service. And just try and brute force most communication through h.323<p>I guess you could try to run H.323 through a $protocol bridge, but I don&#x27;t know why you would want to. Retrofitting modern features onto H.323 does not seem like fun. Because if SIP suffers from being too general, H.323 suffers from being way too specific in its architecture and technology requirements -- read through some of the associated specs, eg H.245, and it&#x27;s not hard to see why SIP won. For the longest time, there was not even the notion of URI addressing...<p>> SIP for phone ... maybe SIP for videochat (but I&#x27;m sceptical<p>In SIP (and most well-designed protocols), there is no fundamental difference between an audio and a video call. It&#x27;s just capability negotiation and RTP. Actual interoperability is the problem... and that is one of the reasons vendors like to create closed networks, so they can guarantee the experience end-to-end.<p>Regarding gating and lock-in: Part of it may be a desire for a proprietary walled garden [1], but a big reason is logistical as well -- one of the reasons Google disabled XMPP federation was because of abuse. This is the same reason you can&#x27;t dial directly into the PSTN without going through a trusted trunk, and why unlicensed use of cellular frequencies (or any RF, really) is illegal.<p>[1] Actually, the reason the PSTN is federated is probably more an accident of history than anything else. If not for the AT&T monopoly (and subsequent breakup), people would have been complaining about siloed telephone services 50 years ago!

Also, the entire application is subject to the regular hiccups: gc requires global safepoints, which are reached by making each thread wait when it reaches a local safepoint; on top of the stop-the-world gc operations themselves.<p>But things are improving: RedHat is developing Shenandoah, a GC that has STW pauses under 10ms.
