7915620,comment,7915512,7915512,1,0,cornholio,,,"Truth be told, if the meat would be produced via the &quot;organic&quot; route, the destruction would be even higher. Industrial agriculture is a way to obtain lots of food cheaply, using little land and capital. Sure, you end up with a bit of fertilizers, hormones and antibiotics in your diet and you might get the occasional food poisoning, but overall it&#x27;s the cheapest way to keep the hungry people of the world fed.<p>As for &#x27;sustainable&#x27; agriculture, the reality is much uglier than the poster would like you to think. The yields are much lower, think 10x lower, pre- green revolution levels. This means that the cost is significantly higher - but also that it much more land and capital intensive. Huge incentives for deforestation.<p>Heck, a truly sustainable agriculture would use only bio-fuels which is barely breaking even energetically, so for each acre of wheat you would need a few more acres of rapeseed or corn to produce the bio-fuel required.<p>All in all, you could say that meat consumption is killing the planet. Since people seem to like meat, the logical conclusion is that we should dissuade them to eat it via a higher prices. Those higher prices would be the natural result of producers internalizing the costs of environmental destruction caused during production, incentivizing the use of sustainable methods.<p>But if this is what you believe in, then take a political position and be prepared to fight for it: &quot;We need more expensive meat, and we need it now !&quot;. Don&#x27;t beat around the bush with the &quot;greedy corporations&quot; conspiracy that are killing the planet for &quot;profits&quot;.",1403179129

7915598,comment,7914682,7915554,3,0,mallamanis,,,"From a machine learning perspective (i.e. theoretically according to my view) this is useful because source code is highly structured with very complex constraints and tons of data available (e.g. every project in GitHub). This means that machine-learning methods for handling such problems need to be developed. Such methods may eventually be useful in other application.<p>Now on the applied side (software engineering, programming languages), such methods (probabilistic machine learning and probabilistic/statistical models) can handle uncertainty with a principled way and provide useful tools to software engineers that exploit the amounts of data that is available both in internal and external codebases. This is something that is not 100% possible with formal tools, that usually require some form of human knowledge to be embedded. For example, you will see on the list above, tools that can do autocompletion, others that suggest &quot;reasonable&quot; renamings or others that help migration of source code between languages and all thanks to data.<p>Hopefully, at some point these methods will be so advanced that they will be able to learn (i.e. trained) from every piece of code that is available online and (e.g.) spot bugs in your code, semi-automatically refactor your code etc.",1403178244

The way Google does things is indeed very rare, your experience at Microsoft is more typical.<p>Note that the path Google chose isn&#x27;t easy! As the codebase got larger and larger they had to basically design and build their own build system, a distributed unit testing engine, custom code refactoring and hyperlinking tools, do major IDE modifications to Eclipse to make projects even loadable, eventually even build their own version control system because no other VCS scaled to the sizes and speeds they needed. They invested a TON of time and gold into allowing a single codebase to scale like that; it&#x27;s practical if you&#x27;re sitting on a hosepipe of money and you can hire brilliant engineers then assign them to build tools, but it&#x27;s probably not practical for most companies despite that the resulting environment was quite pleasant.<p>That said, although the codebase was remarkably consistent, there were still variations. The most notorious was the split between the C++ and Java codebase. Some frameworks were written in c++ and bound into Java using things like SWIG. Others were bound using cross-process RPCs. A lot of smaller libraries were simply written and maintained twice. The culture was different too. Some Java codebases were way over the top of excessive abstraction and use of dependency injection, making them an absolute nightmare to understand or debug for newcomers. Others were simpler and more understandable (typically the older ones). The C++ side felt much more light weight, but on the other hand, it  was largely stuck in the 90s, with memory management being entirely manual even in cases where conservative GC could probably have helped avoid mistakes. When I left C++11 was in the process of being whitelisted one feature at a time.<p>The biggest problem with the culture I had at the time I left (and was one reason I decided to pack my bags after 7.5 years there), was that basic tasks were becoming more and more bureaucratic. Often this was due to poorly designed processes put in place in a panic after some PR disaster around privacy or data handling, like Street View or Buzz. Sometimes it was just because some engineer needed to redesign a widely used system in order to prove they were being &quot;impactful&quot; and get promoted even though it wasn&#x27;t really broken. There was a running joke there that there were two versions of every tool, the deprecated one and the one that didn&#x27;t work yet. It started out as a lighthearted take on the companies rapid progress and by the end unfortunately just reflected a sad reality.<p>As an illustrative example, around the time I started to step back, one member of my team had spent on the order of 6-8 weeks attempting to simply download a file via HTTP in production, from our own servers (was a self test). This task involved filling out forms, arguing with the owners of the HTTP download service (the old one didn&#x27;t require this process but was deprecated), discovering that the new version was hopelessly buggy and was breaking random products for end users without anyone on those teams noticing, etc. This is a task that could be accomplished in two minutes with a random Linux VPS and &quot;wget&quot; but turned into an epic struggle against a Kafkaesque corporate disaster zone. The problem was not that one team was poorly performing though: the problem was the company had lost the ability to pre-emptively catch this or even recognise that there was a problem. Most team members were happy to just collect a paycheque each day; if they got paid for filling out forms justifying why they needed the &quot;fast reliable&quot; HTTP download service instead of the &quot;slow unreliable&quot; service, why worry? Best not to rock the boat.",1403176886

I wouldn&#x27;t have considered this - I mean it&#x27;s blindingly obvious whether a company you&#x27;re working at (or supplying services to, etc) is two kids with an app hiring you, or two kids with an app and 1.2m in cash hiring you.  So if they&#x27;re doing this, it&#x27;s likely they won&#x27;t be hiring anyone, meeting with any real investors, or spending money on anything.  That severely limits the upside of any PR - and that&#x27;s bold.<p>On the other hand if they got some money, just not as much as that, then perhaps they could fluff as you suggest.

What I did was just calculate all tiles (I call them &#x27;cells&#x27;) intersected by the displacement vector of the projectiles (balls) moving around the maze, which can be done in constant time if your maze dimensions are fixed. Then I look up the walls of intersected cells, and calculate the closest intersection of the displacement vector with any of these walls. This intersection happens somewhere along the vector between t=0 and t=1, so I translate the projectile position back in time using this value, change its direction (invert either x or y based on the orientation of the wall), then move it along (1 - t) * v_inverted to solve the &#x27;fast projectiles skipping walls&#x27; problem (this is basically a very simple case of continuous collision detection).<p>If you allow a tiny bit of non-determinism in very rare cases, the edge case where a ball exactly hits an corner doesn&#x27;t need a lot of additional work, you just repeat the intersection test iteratively until there are no more intersecting edges (99 out of 100 cases there will be only 1, and in the remaining case there will be 2, provided that your balls don&#x27;t move faster than 1 unit cell distance per frame).",1403176061
