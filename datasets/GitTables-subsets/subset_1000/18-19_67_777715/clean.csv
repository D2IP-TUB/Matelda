Noisy, crowded work environments lengthen development schedules.""</i><p>The problem with private offices for developers, which is how I read #6 as advocating, is that it separates developers and cuts down communication. If you're a developer you're generally working with a team, and this has no team component.

You need to be able to strike a compromise between privacy and for focus, and openness for communication and making sure that the team has a single, unified vision.

Some of the religious folks would counter-argue that it's in society's best interest, and that no good comes from pot. The other side would say you can't enforce it anyway.

I don't see the principle that you're arguing from here.<p>Your comparisons are a little silly, too. There are good reasons (right of way, regulation) and bad (monopoly concessions, lobbying, corruption) that private utilities own entire markets. These have nothing to do with the forces behind noncompetes. No noncompete has helped establish any company's monopoly in any product or service you can name, even regionally.<p>Noncompetes are a trade. Companies provide employees with access to resources, client lists, and trade secrets. They want to ensure that rolodexes aren't shopped and product plans aren't bootlegged. These are reasonable goals. Employment contracts are blunt and inefficient instruments for accomplishing those goals, but that doesn't make the intent corrupt.",1239386699

You can attempt to address the logarithmic nature of wealth and the perceived unfairness of that.
