What US needs here is not only softer laws, it&#x27;s a whole mindset of flexibility with the law, like we have in more latin or corrupt countries: Tolerance with driving rules, tolerance with income tax workarounds, tolerance with violence on the street. I had a friend in France drop a complaint for fondling of his daughter by a teenager, the cop said the agressor was going to be merely told off in a meeting at the station, nothing more.

I occasionally use q-tips to clean my ears 6 to 8 times a year and have never had any issue with wax or infections.<p>The real ear &quot;killer&quot; out there is loud noise and daily abuse. You&#x27;re more likely to damage your ears listening to earbuds 8 hours, Mon to Fri or going to a monthly concert/club with 100+dB for 4 to 6 hours with no ear protection.<p>Talk to an ENT about serious issue like tinnitus and they&#x27;ll tell you with a straight face that a) they don&#x27;t really know what causes it and b) the prescribed treatment is &quot;just try to ignore it&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t produce a lot of faith that the science is really there. For me this article is closer to fad nutrition advice that consistently contradicts the previous reports.",1453363432
