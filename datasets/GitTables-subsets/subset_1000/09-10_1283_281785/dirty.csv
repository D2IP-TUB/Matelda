Now because of entanglement this also works if we look at chains of interactions: Interaction with another single atom for example is no observation, but if this other atom interacts with a &#x27;classical system&#x27; at some point earlier or later we have again an &#x27;observation&#x27;.<p>Now &#x27;classical systems&#x27; are systems made of so many elements that we can only make statistical statements about it because we can&#x27;t ever determine the state of each of it&#x27;s constituents.<p>I suspect for some time now that this is also the source for the &quot;quantum randomness&quot;. In principle, everything is deterministic, but to observe something we always have interactions with a &quot;big classical system&quot; (in the end it&#x27;s always our brain). And because we don&#x27;t know the exact state of those systems but only statistical averages, quantum mechanics looks random for us, even if it&#x27;s perfectly deterministic in itself.

Tried all of these at various points; haven&#x27;t noticed much difference, but I think I might not have tried enough. Going item-by-item:<p>- Exercising: probably not enough; the amounts I did didn&#x27;t really affect much (except weight), but I&#x27;m going to try again, at a gym this time.<p>- I have problems going to sleeping due to depression and anxiety (I constantly feel I haven&#x27;t done enough yet, so I can&#x27;t go to sleep yet), combined with being generally a night person (after day spent with people I really appreciate the late hours without any face-to-face distractions). But when I finally fall asleep, no force on Earth or in Heaven can wake me before I get my 7-8 hours. Which annoys my employers.<p>- I <i>try</i>, but I just don&#x27;t like green food :(. Cutting out sugar from diet did wonders to my weight and dental health, but didn&#x27;t improve mood issues.<p>- I&#x27;m a very social person, people call bullshit on me when they hear me describing myself as an introvert (I usually send them this classic then: [0]). I frequent various events, both as an attendee and speaker, help run a local Hackerspace and have uncanny ability to serve as a translator between technical and untechnical people.<p>- Piractem & noopept - little to no noticeable effects. Nicotine (pure, in gums, I&#x27;m not a smoker) - helps stay up a little longer and improves my alcohol tolerance. Adrafinil - does wonders when I need to skip a night&#x27;s sleep or feel the stress-induced tiredness during the day. I didn&#x27;t try anything else.<p>> <i>BTW, highly recommend checking out The Healthy Programmer book</i><p>Thanks, I&#x27;ll check it out!

Level 0 consists of 4 1MB files - it will fill in 1/5th of a second, and then compaction will reduce it by 1MB. After that it will be compacting continuously every 1/20th of a second. To sustain this workload for the 1st second will thus require 17 compactions to Level 1. Assuming an already populated Level 1 and worst-case key distribution that means in 1 second it will trigger compactions that read 238MB and write 238MB to store the incoming 20MB.<p>Level 1 is only 10MB, so if it was empty it would fill in the first 1/2 second. For the remaining 1/2 second it would trigger 5 more compactions to Level 2, reading 130MB and writing 130MB. If it started out full then this would be 260MB/260MB respectively.<p>So for a 20MB/sec input workload you would need a disk subsystem capable of sustaining 498MB/sec of reads concurrent with 498MB/sec of writes. And that&#x27;s only for a small DB, only Level 0-2 present (smaller than 110MB), and excluding the actual cost of filesystem operations (create/delete/etc).<p>That&#x27;s only for the 1st second of load. For every second after that, you&#x27;re dumping from Level 0 to Level 1 at 280MB read and 280MB write/sec. And dumping from Level 1 to Level 2 at 260/260 as before. 540/540 - so a disk capable of 1080MB/sec I/O is needed to sustain a 20MB/sec workload. And this is supposed to be HDD-optimized? Write-optimized? O(N logN) - what a laugh.<p>Maybe LSMs in general can be more efficient than this. LevelDB is pretty horrible though.",1445593100

At least for Python, I can confidently say that they are not at all painful. Yes, there is fragmentation between different oAuth providers but unless you are writing oAuth library yourself, you may not need to face these problems ever.\nFyi, I am not using any oAuth lib but then I only use google auth for my app, not fb or twitter.",1445590920

In that case a third party who pledges support to either of them might easily influence the settlement agreement.<p>Consider this very realistic scenario: Two parties jointly own a piece of real estate. One of the parties wants to sell the property but the other party does not, because the market is not prime for it. They also cannot afford to buy the others share themselves. So they have a legal disagreement. This will most likely end in settlement as none of them wants to actually go to court. Now a property developer comes in and pledges to fund the guy who wants to sell. That skews their settlement agreement in favour of him and the other guy is forced to sell (to the property developer obviously) at below market value.",1445590902

Mostly personal experience of my own teaching along with my parents who both taught.<p>> (2) demands actual evidence, since the implication that male teachers will, what? allow things to escalate to physical violence? Hardly belies any real improvement in teaching outcomes.<p>There are two pieces to this.  One is physical and one is social.<p>As for physical: if I&#x27;m managing a classroom, I have a lot of authority by virtue of being 6&quot;+, 100bs+ bigger than most of the students.  My voice alone is far more powerful than that of a woman.  In addition, I can embarrass or insult a troublemaker without much fear of physical repercussion.  This is really huge as it gives me a lot of graded options that a woman would have to think twice about.  And, at bottom, the students have to wonder exactly how much damage I could do to them if they really push me into a corner.<p>As for social: my personal experience is that a lot of female teachers want compliance (personal control dynamic) while male teachers can function as long as there is no interference (group outcome dynamic).  A good example of this was an exchange between my parents:<p><female> &quot;I want them to quit chewing tobacco in my class&quot; (Note: personal control dynamic).<p><male> &quot;Well, you&#x27;re not going to get that without throwing somebody out of class every day.  Are you willing to disrupt your class for that?&quot;<p><female> &quot;Not really.&quot;<p><male> &quot;Okay, so presumably you could ignore it if they don&#x27;t spit in the back of the class (group outcome dynamic)?&quot;<p><female> &quot;I guess, but ...&quot;<p><male> &quot;Fine.  That&#x27;s achievable by telling them: &quot;If you&#x27;re man enough to chew, you&#x27;re man enough to swallow it (Note: peer embarrassment).  If I see any on the floor, all the people I see chewing are cleaning it.&quot;  Now they&#x27;ll police each other, and you&#x27;ll only occasionally have to send one to the office.&quot;<p>> there are a LOT of female teachers that actively try to gain their student&#x27;s approval.<p>Go teach at a school.  There are always quite a few women who want to be &quot;buds&quot; with the students.  I don&#x27;t really see this among the men except in the genuinely dangerous cases.",1445590851

But you can&#x27;t ignore them in real implementations. First the actual writes have a 2x constant factor, since you&#x27;re writing to a WAL in addition to the DB itself.<p>The original LSM paper claims that writes to Level 0 are free because that&#x27;s all in-memory. But that&#x27;s not really true; if you have a stream of incoming writes then everything that goes into Level 0 must eventually be pushed out to Level 1. Buffering doesn&#x27;t make writes free, it only displaces their occurrence in time.<p>So you have a rolling merge every M writes. As far as Big-O goes, that&#x27;s N log(N) / M == N log(N) because Big-O disregards constant factors!<p>In the context of an implementation like LevelDB, theory and reality diverge even further. Since it&#x27;s chunking data into 2MB files and deleting them during each merge operation, and also writing a bunch of bookkeeping into Manifest files and other stuff, the number of actual I/Os is much higher. A lot of wasted activity in allocating and deallocating space - filesystem metadata overhead that&#x27;s also not transactionally safe.<p>In LevelDB a single merge reads 26MB and writes 26MB at a time to push 2MB of data from a level L to level L+1. So now instead of a single merge op costing only N, it actually costs 13*N. Again, if you&#x27;re only talking about Big-O complexity you sweep this under the rug. But in reality, this is a huge cost.",1445590800
