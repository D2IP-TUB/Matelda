If you look at most startup's pitch/plan the biggest risks are not in technology.<p>Steve Blank would say there's Market Risk (will your customers want it?) but minimal Invention Risk (can you deliver it?). Contrast this with biotech where you're trying to cure diseases. Minimal market risk, tons  of invention risk.

832782,comment,832672,832672,0,0,danielrhodes,,,"I found the article was rather long and a bit confusing. I wanted to summarize and clarify it:<p>There are more companies these days, but VCs are funding the same number of companies as before with the same huge expectations. Why not instead fund more companies with a lower amount of cash so as to not miss some opportunities.<p>My answer: putting all your eggs in one basket in a competitive environment will likely lead to better results than spreading the money out among a bunch of different baskets. Most startups are going to fail anyways, even with $200K of funding because the markets they are hitting are not that huge, not to mention all the other hurdles. What funding a bunch of different companies does is make a clear market winner harder to come by, which screws everybody. It's better if there was one clear winner sooner rather than later. My bet is handing out smaller investments like $200K would actually make the IPO market worse since most companies would get too tired to ever make it big enough to IPO.<p>The quick answer to why IPOs have not been good recently (other than the economy sucking): Sarbannes-Oxley made it very expensive to IPO with big requirements which means that the next best exit is selling. To sell, you have to get big fast to become attractive to suitors. Profitability/revenue is not a requirement/important for selling to a larger company (they use startups to cheaply get new talent and good ideas rather than quickly adding new revenue streams). So why don't more companies focus on revenue as a backup plan? It's very distracting and doing so means you might only scrape by. With such a do or die environment, the goal is not to create good businesses which will survive, just ones that will become great.<p>The good thing is that as it has become cheaper to run a startup, people have more options and can create self-funded sustainable businesses aimed at smaller markets. You won't become a billionaire doing that, but you'll get by. That's fine with VCs though, they are after big returns. If you are comfortable with creating such a business, by all means do so, but don't be pissed when a VC is not interested, even if it does make a little money. There is clearly room for both. If you do hit on a massive market opportunity, they can always catch up with you later.<p>So what is something like Y Combinator? It is a cheap way to vet companies for VCs and angels who see too many startups without enough information on them to make a good value judgement on whether they'll succeed. You don't need $200K to do that, you just need a small amount of money.",1253426155
832781,comment,832737,832769,0,0,TriinT,,,"I wholeheartedly agree. When so many seem to be seeking exit strategies, like an IPO or an acquisition, it's refreshing to see that some still think in a more long-term basis and battle to build businesses that will grow more organically throughout their entire lifetimes.<p>It's a bit like planting sequoias versus planting eucalyptuses.

It would be the same as insurance for the smaller things.  Leaving insurance to cover larger things.  As far as I can tell the worst of the problem is caused by insurances and the related need for medical billers.  Another interesting group are the Ideal Medical Practice Doctors.

832764,comment,832615,832615,0,0,leif,,,"I skimmed more and read less of the original article as I went along, but from what I got, it just seems like he's trying too hard to make a clean, academic argument regarding the publishing industry.  It's been around so long that it's full of exceptions, caveats, inefficiencies, and idiosyncrasies, not to mention the countless people wrapped up in it financially and psychologically, and this, I think, makes it too difficult to reason about as generally as he tries.<p>My biggest beef, though, comes when he claims that publishers don't sell content.  Of course they do, and if they didn't, why did he even bring up the price difference between Time and The Economist (is one printed on shinier paper?  Probably, but that's not why anyone buys The Economist).  Some of the price is obviously determined by the medium, too (just as in music sales), and of course countless other factors, and there's no reason to try to narrow it down to just one.  When the method of conveyance disappears, everything will shift around a bit and make everyone uncomfortable (like it's doing now), but eventually settle down not far from where it started.  These systems aren't static sets of rules being followed blindly by their executives, they'll adapt to fit their market.<p>This whole thing seems weird.  When did Paul get this faultily academic?",1253424691

This is a sign that health care is in the process of fixing itself.<p>If you have 45 minutes to kill, you can listen here (<a href=""http://dpcare.org/wa_health_underwriters"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dpcare.org/wa_health_underwriters</a>) to a Seattle doctor talk about the issues, his company's approach, and why direct primary care is such a good thing.  He advocates concierge care as opposed to the Walmart care discussed in the article, and I find the approach to be more sound.  His approach is like Performace Based Logistics for medicine--the doctor that keeps you healthier makes more money, and I like that incentive.  Nonetheless, both his solution and the Walmart solution are attempts at taking advantage of the same idea: paying directly for primary care can both lower costs and improve quality because the time and money required to pay for routine things with insurance is so terribly high.<p>I am convinced we are witnessing the birth of a revolution in medical care.

832757,comment,831421,831761,0,0,Kadin,,,"The comparison is not apt; you seem to be invoking airlines in the belief that they are a similarly capital-intensive industry.  This is not really true.  You can start up an airline with a bunch of rented or chartered planes, so you don't have to buy much of anything.  (And even if you do want to buy them, investors know that they can be sold later and take that into account when loaning you money.)<p>You can't really do that if you want to be a modern ISP.  (At one point, due to line-sharing rules, you could be a DSL ISP without too much infrastructure investment, but this is no longer true; the rules were gutted a few years back and with them went most of the small mom-and-pop DSL operations.)  It's a hell of a lot harder to get investment for a fiber deployment---which won't be worth much of anything if the business folds---than it is to buy an aircraft, which at the end of the day will still be a valuable asset.<p>The industries in question have very little in common, so it should come as no surprise that strategies to induce competition within them look totally dissimilar as well.",1253424019
