No, you wouldn't, because Ruby on Rails is built on top of the language, just as jQuery is built on top of javascript.<p>Sit down sometime and read the source of jQuery and you will very quickly see that javascript is a really cool language that you can do cool stuff in.

Do you just want to capture your ideas so you are able to review important TODO items, insights, and the rationale for decisions you've made later, if needed?  Or is the purpose to document your work so that if you develop an important, patentable invention you have adequate documentation for a legally defensible patent?  If legal defense of a patent is the intent, then consulting with an attorney about your documentation methods long before you've invented anything is the wise thing to do.  My guess is that old-fashioned signed, dated, & witnessed dead-tree paper records are probably still preferred.",1291339354

Bank transfer? Some other way?<p>2) If you're a foreign startup, how did you collect payments from US customers? Do I need to get an Australian merchant account to accept CC payments? Can I, as a non-US citizen, start an American company so that BrainTree can give me an American merchant account?<p>I'm not asking for legal advice here, just some indication of how others have solved this problem before me.",1291339045
