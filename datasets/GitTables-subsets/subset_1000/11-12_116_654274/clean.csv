I remember this objection being made at the time these laws were proposed.<p>Then again this is actually beneficial to a surveillance state as this can be used to put even more surveillance and get the population to accept it.<p>This is no different as using CP and piracy as pretexts for Internet censorship, or from a web company running on investor story time admitting that advertising revenue currently sucks but this means there is much room for improvement.<p>If you drank the koolaid and actually believe that surveillance was effective in preventing terrorism or catching terrorists afterwards, well I&#x27;m sorry you got duped.",1420804751

8861814,comment,8860738,8861162,0,0,chernevik,,,"Yep.  The tests are there because people don&#x27;t trust the schools and looking for some independent means of motivating them to get better.  Unfortunately, the testing architecture isn&#x27;t entirely appropriate to the task -- but scrapping it just brings us back to the core problem.<p>The reality is that many of the schools, and many of the teachers, are just bad.  This can&#x27;t be acknowledged in the public debate, so it isn&#x27;t addressed.  The unions have established a structure dedicated to protecting bad and mediocre teachers.  Which is why great teachers can&#x27;t get paid appropriately -- the unions would never allow it.  It&#x27;s also why teachers don&#x27;t enjoy higher status: As a group, they really don&#x27;t deserve it.<p>Yes, the unions are right that, without tenure and their workplace rules, teacher hiring and pay would be a political game.  That&#x27;s what political systems do, they respond to political incentives.  That&#x27;s the whole idea of charters: to move the accountability of the schools out of the political system and into the hands of a constituency invested in actual quality.  It&#x27;s probably true that _today_ parents as a group aren&#x27;t completely equipped to handle that role, because they&#x27;ve been trained to just send their kids off to school.  But as they get the opportunity to make more decisions and influence the schools&#x27; offerings, they&#x27;ll come up to speed.<p>tldr; The testing apparatus is a symptom of a broken governance apparatus.  The solution is to fix the governance and incentives.  So long as the incentives are political, the results will be political.",1420804175
8861813,comment,8860738,8861701,0,0,deong,,,"> You seem to be assuming that it&#x27;s impossible to bail out the bank&#x27;s clients and let the bank itself fail, but that is not, in fact, impossible.<p>It probably <i>was</i> impossible. Banks don&#x27;t just function as holding pens for your money. They&#x27;re (by design) overly leveraged based on the idea that not everyone will want their money at the same time. If the bank fails, you need to come up with all the money at once, and there was never that much money in the bank to begin with.<p>Maybe you could have handled this by some system in which you backed people&#x27;s deposits with things like bonds, but at a minimum, it&#x27;s pretty complicated. It&#x27;s easier, and probably better in the long run, to just reassure everyone that their money is safe in the bank, and give the bank whatever is needed to ensure that promise is kept.<p>Where we went wrong was in failing to meaningfully change the system that incentivized and allowed the failure to occur in the first place. We probably couldn&#x27;t have done anything to avoid bailing them out the first time, but we could be doing much more to avoid the need to do it again and again in the future, but we&#x27;re not, because the banks own the government and don&#x27;t want us to.",1420804173

I also have a not-so-great CPU (but a high end GPU) so that affects too. In any case, my computer is able to run quite high end games, it should easily be able to run a simple terrain demo if it weren&#x27;t for the overhead.<p>There&#x27;s certainly different performance characteristics in different OpenGL implementations (ie. GPUs) but WebGL overhead comes on top of that. So in addition to the performance characteristics of the GPU itself, you have to think about the browser&#x27;s software implementation too.<p>WebGL is definitely a welcome addition to the facilities available in the browser, but getting more up-to-date features would be nice. And using the security features (especially bounds checking) of the hardware if available to avoid unnecessary overhead would make it a lot more appealing.",1420801392

The founder has thought about their problem for months, maybe even years, while the average VC might never have thought about it. Suddenly they are faced with responding to the founder and in a manner that allows them to control future negotiations. If they are average they will try to control the situation with aggressive questions that attempt to throw the founder off guard. In this sort of tactic they have far more experience than most founders.",1420801389
