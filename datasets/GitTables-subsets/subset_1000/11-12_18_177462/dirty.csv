This revenue streams are beginning to dry out.""</i><p>The great thing about people responding to posts that have data with generalised assumptions is they usually don't add data. Do you have any data to support your claim?<p>I know that this year, MS has had a drop in sales as a result of the global economic slowdown, but so has pretty much everyone else out there, so before you say ""But XYZ company hasn't..."", realise this, they're probably one of the outlier cases.<p>In an economy that has claimed several banks, 2 automotive institutions and countless other businesses, Microsoft is still able to maintain a profitable position even after having to fork out close to $300 million in severance packages, in a down market.<p>You also forget that Microsoft has the Xbox platform, their Windows Mobile empire and they are attempting to diversify their businesses further into many more markets.<p>They're not in a bad position.

I'm sure there's some sort of ceiling on that (IANAL) which prevents you from copy+paste-ing broad swaths of text into your work and ""citing"" it.<p>The key is the citation, which is where the author screwed up.

That aside:<p>I'm going to run some quick numbers for B2C software, based on the 1k downloads a day estimate and a few guesttimates from my experience:<p>Page views: ~4k<p>CPM rate: ~$2.50 ~ $5  (CPM rates for OSS sites that target businesses which spend money on big business stuff can be fairly high.  For consumer OSS, not so much.  The salient feature of consumer OSS users is that they like getting things for free -- how much would YOU pay to advertise your software to them?)<p>Ads: $600 per month on the high end<p>Donations: 10 a month or so, average will be for below $5.<p>Paid Support: For B2C software?  I consider myself an incurable optimist.  I am feeling cured now.<p>My suggestion: if you want to make money selling software, then you should try selling software.  You're worried about your community forking it.  Your community is not capable of forking it, nor do they have the inclination to do the amount of work required to do so.  They are here for the free stuff.  It is highly likely that there is no copy of your source code anywhere except on your committers' computers and whatever your centrally accessible repository is.  If you were to turn that off one day, the source code would no longer be available.  And if you were to disable download of the free version, somebody might actually notice.<p>You are worried a pro edition will make you your own biggest competitors.  Welcome to every shareware business ever.  We all compete with ourselves, effectively.  It isn't trivial but it isn't impossible, either.  (Hint: feature limitations on behavior which identifies the people who most need your software work great.)<p>[Edit to add: You may consider white-label versions to customize to the requirements of studios&etc needing marketing devices.

It has potential. It's just a damn shame the technology is so damn expensive to gain much traction.<p>As for Project Natal, I can think of some very good ideas off the top of my head that it can be useful for - not just gaming. It could end up being one of the things that turns the 360 from a gaming console into a central home computing platform and communications tool for you and your family  (like was alluded too in one of the advertising videos)<p>Microsoft attempting to commoditize 3D cameras like they are could make interfaces like you see in minority report a reality much sooner than was previously thought.",1245843371
671918,comment,671846,671846,0,0,DirtyAndy,,,"There are three things I would look at first and foremost\n1. Name - pinkdy really isn't that memorable and has little to do with getting pregnant. With competitors like fertilityfriend and knowmycycle and mymonthlycycles you probably need something that is a little more descriptive\n2. Landing Page\n3. SEO<p>When I first read this I thought you were going into a market that was way too crowded for you ever to succeed (in English at least). But actually the top search results for ""track menstrual cycle"" and ""track period"" and several other searches are not that strong and with the right SEO you should be able to break into the top results. The landing pages of your competitors are awful. Too much text and too much of it in light pink which is hard to read. A simple high impact landing page could help you beat a lot of your competitors - but that isn't going to help if you cannot drive people to your site with the right SEO.<p>Two other ideas for you to think about. 1. what is the market like for other languages? Maybe there is a lack of Spanish language competitors etc - it might be easier to get going with them first. 2. I don't know if you can create a widget that can be included on forums, but there are a lot of womens forums around where they discuss all sorts of things. A lot of these women are trying to get pregnant and if you can tap into them on those forums it could be a good marketing opportunity.<p>Obviously as everyone else has said here, do get the English right, and it could be worth checking if someone in a foreign country uses the site and for some reason feels they want to sue you that you are safe.<p>Good luck.",1245843318
671915,comment,671852,671893,0,0,jasonkester,,,"Yeah, psychology must have something to do with it.  I think it has something to do with knowing exactly what sort of effort went in to the project.<p>We tend to think of Commercial Software as this Big thing that Big teams from Big companies spend years to develop.  Windows took 400 man-years or whatever to develop and it only costs $79 a copy.  Why should my thing that I spent less than 500 hours on be worth that much?<p>From the outside though, nobody else can tell how hard it was to build.  They only see that it solves their problem and that it's valuable.<p>It's a false dichotomy (hard to build vs. valuable).  We all have stories of the 3-day hack we built that made the company $400K, and we've all seen marketing guys go nuts thinking that our little internal tool could be re-packaged as the Next Big Thing.  If only we could muster that sort of enthusiasm about our own stuff, we'd be a lot more likely to put a price tag on it.",1245843017

671896,comment,671055,671831,0,0,spyrosk,,,"-Nice weather today.. :P<p>Seriously, my best method of starting a chat with a stranger is making a comment about something in the surrounding environment quickly followed by a question about the other person. Try not to talk about the weather as this usually raises a ""red flag"", ie I really want to talk to you but dont know how.<p>After that, it's mostly questions/answers as you start to get acquainted. Question/answer ratio in your speaking time should be around 80/20. Try to keep your answers relatively short, especially in the beggining, so that you don't bore your conversational partner. You can usually tell if he/she is genuinely interested in a subject as he will request more information about it. As for the questions let him/her finish his answer, nod, have an open body posture, copy his/hers with a 5sec delay and while he/she answers think of the next one. Give some time between his answer and the next question (his/hers or yours) but be ready to fire in case the conversation drifts off to that ""awkward silence"".<p>In any case try to remember that people like to talk about themselves (hence the question/answer ratio) but this isn't always the case, e.g. you have met an introvert (takes time to start opening up) or someone who's having a bad day (difficult to change his/her mood).<p>Finally, if you fail, don't sweat it. Find what/where the conversation went wrong change your tactic a bit (alter talking speed, think of better generally applied questions, humor) and try again. And don't forget to smile :)",1245841323
