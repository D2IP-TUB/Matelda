What should have been done long ago is standardising plates, cups and cutlery and creating integrated dish cabinet/washer that can wash those standardised items and store them. The fact that in 2014 we still rely on manual work to wash the dishes is a disgrace perpetrated by oversupply of cheap human work.</i><p>And what, exactly, do you propose that we <i>do</i> about this &quot;oversupply of cheap human work&quot;?  If we simply ignore it, there&#x27;ll be hell to pay. The old saying, <i>idle hands are the devil&#x27;s workshop</i>, is based on millennia of human experience.<p>Suppose that all the dishwashers in the U.S. were suddenly to find themselves both (1) out of a job, and (2) as a result, unable to earn enough money to feed themselves and their families.<p>Now consider that for some of these people, retraining them to seek out and hold other jobs might not be much of an option.  There are some people who, for whatever reason, simply <i>can&#x27;t</i> learn the necessary skills / behaviors / motivations.  (If you&#x27;re inclined to scorn that notion, or such people, consider how little we really know about human learning abilities and motivation; such people are more common than you perhaps imagine.)<p>Are our unemployed dishwashers going to sit around passively and accept their fate, watching their families do without <i>while they see others around them prospering?</i>  Not bloody likely --- they&#x27;re going to try to do something about it.  And some percentage of them are going to make trouble, e.g., by robbing or cheating others, dealing drugs, rioting, etc.<p>From a purely-pragmatic perspective, if we want to keep our vaunted social order intact, then we&#x27;re going to have to figure out how to keep people (A) occupied in reasonable contentment, and (B) reasonably-well fed, -clothed, -housed, etc.  This is a brute fact, which we can like or not, but which we disregard at our peril.",1393160019

I really should check ... but what if it&#x27;s already too late? I&#x27;d feel awful ... no, let&#x27;s not feel awful, let&#x27;s check sometime later.&quot; Poof, thought gone until next time. When you suffer from GAD or any other psychological disorder involving anxiety, about the only thing you can do is understand your fears and your reactions to them, and take small steps towards reinterpretation. Fighting anxiety with inducing more anxiety is not going to work.<p>The problem with ignoring your feelings is that it&#x27;s much easier said than done.

In situations like getting up in the morning, techniques involving subconsciousness like [1] are more likely to work.<p>We are more feeling-driven than we think ourselves to be, and that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing. Those feelings are there for a reason, and ignoring them might just not work. Indeed, the author acknowledges that &quot;on some level you need to be committed to what you are doing&quot; and I think when he says &quot;ignore not feeling like doing something,&quot; he actually means &quot;_trick_ your mind into starting feeling like doing that.&quot;<p>The problem with using if-then planning is that for some people, it&#x27;s all too easy to change the decision, even if it&#x27;s already been done; the unconscious mind keeps re-examining the decision and re-pondering the issue at hand. So when the time comes, you end up re-considering the decision instead of deliberating what to do. That&#x27;s not exactly the same thing, but it still eats up willpower.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right-away-when-your-alarm-goes-off/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right...</a>",1393158542
