Knowledge of this refuge changes the way you feel about circumstances and mental phenomena (motion).  The change just feels right, like a lessening of burden, but it takes practice, that&#x27;s the thing.  The rituals and calligraphy are not the thing.",1412557051
8413934,comment,8411356,8411767,1,0,krick,,,"Well, saying that you &quot;worked for google as a programmer&quot; sounds a bit more impressive than you &quot;worked for google as a cleaner&quot;, because google is a tech company. It is all about public image, so if you are a programmer then it is pretty natural your contract is stating that there is notable difference between you and, say, Sebastian Thrun in the sense of your importance for google. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be necessary to say that some security guard&#x27;s role in google wasn&#x27;t like one of Sebastian Thrun, so why not?",1412557008
8413933,comment,8412948,8412948,0,0,lisper,,,"This proposal assumes that the goal of top-tier colleges is to find the best and the brightest and give them an exceptional education, which will enable them to become even bester and brighterer.  But that&#x27;s wrong.  The goal of top-tier colleges is inculcate people into a particular social class.  Ivy league grads run the world, not because they&#x27;re so much better and brighter than everyone else, but because the people who run the world were indoctrinated to believe that only ivy-league grads are capable of running the world, and so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  How do I know?  Because people still care where you went to college even decades after you graduate.  They stop caring about your GPA, but they never stop caring about your alma mater.  If it were about achievement, then where you went to school should stop mattering after a decade or two or three, just like your GPA, but it doesn&#x27;t.

I&#x27;ve read long ago resveratrol especially discussing the content in different regions and grape types across in Europe and also why Muscadine grape (native to Florida) has the highest amounts - few times higher than Spanish reds. I think Oregon is also better suited for healthier wines as well. I don&#x27;t have anything handy, unfortunately as I have the bad habit not to organize my findings outside of keeping the conclusions read or made in my head, but those reads made me switch to Spanish Rioja from French Pinot Noir. I never looked at the map before now, but it seems that Rioja&#x27;s location is very well-situated for higher resveratrol and the wine is great. :)",1412556912

Things started becoming a bit more complex with the &#x27;286 and its protected mode, and then the &#x27;386+ with 32-bit and its various protected-mode enhancements really made it harder for a single person to master fully, but I think it was still mostly possible; the really hairy stuff started with 64-bit mode and all the extensions (e.g. virtualisation) that have been made to that since.<p>On the non-x86 side, modern ARM SoCs like the ones used in smartphones are not all that much simpler despite a less complex CPU core - they&#x27;re still thousands of pages of documentation in total.",1412556534

8413915,comment,8411356,8411356,1,0,krick,,,"I see many comments here be like &quot;security is important for google, so paying guards more is a wise move&quot;. That isn&#x27;t really true. If you want to keep something safe the real question isn&#x27;t if your employee wants to abuse you, but if he <i>can</i>. Security is about being sure that damage that can be made by every single person you entrusted with access to something is reasonably low. Because if somebody can blow you up, him being your own employee and not a contractor, or paying him nice wage doesn&#x27;t guarantee enough. Consider Snowden.<p>Now about wages. I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m saying such obvious things on HN, but there&#x27;s some visible ignorance in comments on that topic. Developers aren&#x27;t paid more than cleaners because being developer is somehow better by itself. Wages are dictated by market, so the question is if you can find somebody who can do the same work while being paid less. Of course I don&#x27;t know what specific purpose will serve these security guys hired by google, but if we&#x27;re talking about something like sitting all day long watching nobody enters using other tools than his NFC card then answer is definitely yes, finding a guy who can do <i>that</i> is easier than finding a guy who can write efficient js or something like that.<p>I <i>do</i> think that hiring your own security staff is convenient (and I&#x27;m a bit surprised it wasn&#x27;t the case before â€” I suppose it isn&#x27;t like they are founding their own Blackwater), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as important as some journalists are implying and sure it isn&#x27;t about social equality.",1412556132

8413908,comment,8412679,8413741,1,0,rglullis,,,"Oh, man...<p>Short answer: By not storing wallets in computers <i>at all</i>.<p>Long, technical-focused answer: Paper wallets. Hardware wallets. USB drives that boot into a read-only operating system with your keys and a BTC client. Old cell phones that can be repurposed to run btc client software... you don&#x27;t need to have a computer of your own to keep a wallet. And I haven&#x27;t even mentioned hosted services! There is nothing (besides government regulation) stopping shop owners who work with M-Pesa to also offer &quot;BTC vault services&quot;: using multi-sig, any BTC deposited in an account needs to be authorized by the vault.<p>Longer, human-focused answer: stop thinking that the problem in underdeveloped countries is lack of access to material things. The problem with underdeveloped countries is the lack of consolidated, stable, sound institutions. The technicalities of how to use BTC (or any cryptocurrency) is not the problem, they can adapt by themselves to a new gadget. What they can&#x27;t do - by themselves - is to create these institutions that the people in the developed world take for granted.<p>A farmer will have access to Internet (just not so fast/ubiquitous/cheap), the thing they don&#x27;t have is a bank to give them decent insurance in case their crops go bad, or any one to give them credit so that s/he can finance the purchase of supplies. They <i>will</i> have access to smartphones (not your &quot;premium&quot; iPhone, but that is only 2-3 years away by Moore&#x27;s Law) and they will have cell phone access. What they don&#x27;t have is a government that is stable enough to guarantee the money sent directly to him is as good as the money sent through some corrupt bureaucrat, or taxed away, or inflated away.<p>The cool thing about BTC is how it completely disrupts the finance/banking industry. It turns a socio-economic-political problem into a technological one. It allows people who live in poor institutions to completely bypass them.<p>---<p>So, to summarize: if you are an American whose only concern is to keep your money and the convenience that it is only possible due to the stable institutions that your country provides, by all means stay out of any crypto-currency. But if you&#x27;d like to live in a world where the barriers are down, with free flow of people and services and goods, then by all means take a look at BTC - not as way to get rich quickly, but as a way to make the world freer.",1412555820

8413905,comment,8412897,8413674,1,0,ewzimm,,,"Right, which is related to but different from the article, which says that introducing a cheaper option drives people to spend less and choose lower quality for less money rather than paying a little more for better quality. But I am not disagreeing with the original point. I agree that Sony might have a motivation to get people to rent for shorter periods, such as encouraging willingness to try more games because of less money devoted to a single game. But I think the dominating factor is just being able to advertise below $5.<p>But there could be other factors, like making it such a bad deal that people feel better about themselves when they avoid it. In a traditional retail store, you often can choose between multiple brands of the same thing. Different video games have some pretty big qualitative differences, so you can&#x27;t consider choosing between games to be the same as choosing between bleach. You can usually shop around different stores to find better deals and feel good about yourself about finding a better price. But with digital distribution, when you are the only store someone can shop at, there&#x27;s no choice and no way to feel good about finding a good deal except for sales. With streaming, there might be occasional sales, but they probably want to keep prices pretty even, so they need to invent a bad deal to allow you to feel good about avoiding it.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it will last though, and I bet the length will get extended, because seeing that your store is willing to offer you a really bad deal is probably worse than the benefits of feeling smart enough to avoid it.<p>Either way, I would much rather buy used games for $5 rather than rent them for any length of time.",1412555759

More likely you are being affected by increased scrutiny around ads promoting anything remotely resembling sex/prostitution/shady personal ads.  The difference between this and dating is probably difficulty for an algorithm to figure out automatically.  The small players promoting shady stuff are getting stopped automatically, but the bigger players doing similar things are not because they have the means to escalate issues to real people or are white listed.

There are quite a variety of different scams and ways of dealing with them. The Mt Gox manipulation worked out as something like a ponzi scheme where players selling at a profit were bought out by Mt Gox&#x27;s bot using money coming in from new players.

To us, the ability to run tests in a few seconds vs over a minute is important, because we want the dev feedback loop to be as immediate as possible.
