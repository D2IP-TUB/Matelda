Its onset each evening is called the dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO).<p>>It is principally blue light, around 460 to 480 nm, that suppresses melatonin, proportional to the light intensity and length of exposure... Kayumov et al. showed that light containing only wavelengths greater than 530 nm does not suppress melatonin in bright-light conditions. Use of blue-blocking goggles the last hours before bedtime has also been advised for people who need to adjust to an earlier bedtime, as melatonin promotes sleepiness.<p>>When used several hours before sleep according to the phase response curve for melatonin in humans, small amounts (0.3 mg) of melatonin shift the circadian clock earlier, thus promoting earlier sleep onset and morning awakening.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin</a>",1411307573

In D3D this used to be offloaded into a separate D3DX API, but AFAIK this is no longer supported in Windows8 (at least in the WinRT API) and has been moved into separate mostly personal projects (e.g. <a href=""http://directxtex.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://directxtex.codeplex.com/</a>). A 3D rendering API should only be concerned about efficient 3D rendering and not burden itself with specific resource file formats. For OpenGL there&#x27;s plenty of libraries to choose from, for instance:<p>- glm for math (<a href=""http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.5/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.5/index.html</a>)<p>- gli for texture loading (<a href=""http://gli.g-truc.net/0.5.1/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gli.g-truc.net/0.5.1/index.html</a>)<p>- assimp for general asset loading: <a href=""http://assimp.sourceforge.net/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://assimp.sourceforge.net/index.html</a><p>- the STB headers (not OpenGL specific): <a href=""https://github.com/nothings/stb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nothings/stb</a><p>- GLFW as window system glue and input wrapper<p>- ...and more which I am not aware of or forgot to list<p>GPU vendors also have SDKs and especially debugging tools (e.g. NVIDIA nSight which integrates into VStudio). It&#x27;s not in one place like in DirectX, but on the other hand, the OpenGL world has a lot more platforms and usage scenarios to cover then D3D or the various new-style APIs like Metal or Mantle (these are the actual motivation for OpenGL-Next, reducing overhead even when this means a lower-level API which is even more focuses and harder to use then before).",1411306754

8347125,comment,8346570,8346811,13,0,jerf,,,"Every so often, after a particularly painful bout with interactive Bash, I find myself mentally designing some shell replacement based on some other language, sometimes custom, sometimes something like Python. And I always end up reminding myself of the same conclusion... nobody will use the resulting interactive shell, because the bash defaults and error handling and stuff <i>mostly</i> make sense interactively (I mean, I can quibble, but let&#x27;s admit that most of us are pretty comfortable with them in interactive mode), and making everything more explicit in some hypothetical replacement will also make everything more annoying to use. It&#x27;s hard for me to make anything that&#x27;s more terse than Bash, and for an interactive shell that&#x27;s a big deal.<p>However, the interactive use case makes one big assumption, which is that you, a human being, are sitting there, statement by statement, and looking at all the output. It assumes the &quot;return codes&quot; of commands are advisory, and not something you literally want to see on every command. It assumes that if you&#x27;re having trouble with some escape sequence you can interactively work out what you&#x27;re doing with &quot;echo&quot; or &quot;ls&quot; or something. It&#x27;s fundamentally built around expecting to be interactive.<p>It is unsurprising that that assumption doesn&#x27;t work out well when trying to program in it. Where it makes sense for interactive Bash to be somewhat sloppy with things and expect the human to pick up the pieces, and to be clear that is 100% true, not sarcasm, that&#x27;s a terrible thing in a programming language. It takes a bare minimum of set -e (stop on errors) and set -u (stop if unset var used) just to turn it into a semblance of a safe language, and that&#x27;s still just putting lipstick on a pig.<p>I&#x27;m not terribly convinced that a shell can be optimized for both interactive and programmatic use... certainly the two modes will be fighting with each other in the design even if you pull it off, and the whole will be more complicated than an interactive-optimized language + &quot;just use Perl/Python/etc&quot;. Of course it&#x27;s too late to remove shell scripting for bash or UNIX, but the more serious the task you&#x27;re trying to do, the less you should be reaching for shell scripting to do it with.<p>Unless you&#x27;re doing something in which you really don&#x27;t care that the script hit an error halfway through and it&#x27;s just fine for the entire script to keep blundering along despite having no idea what&#x27;s going on at that point.",1411306687

Comments and clarifications welcome!<p>-----<p>Is homoiconicity about concrete syntax?  I think the answer is <i>no</i> , but I also think that this confuses lots of people because it&#x27;s not explicitly stated.<p>Then is homoiconicity about abstract syntax?  Let&#x27;s say we have some arbitrary language, for which there&#x27;s an eval function (input: abstract syntax tree, output: some data structure) whose job is to execute/evaluate a program in that language.  Homoiconicity, then, is the case where the output data structure is also an abstract syntax tree, or conversely, that an abstract syntax tree is expressed in data structures of the language.<p>So for homoiconicity, the input and output of your eval function are of the same type (of course the type may be a complicated algebraic sum type etc.).  Thus the input and output have the same domain.  This means that you can take the output from eval, and throw it back into eval again without getting a type error.<p>If the input and output types of the eval function don&#x27;t match, then the language isn&#x27;t homoiconic.<p>Is this correct?<p>What I don&#x27;t get is whether the eval function is available from inside or outside the language, or both.<p>I&#x27;m also unsure of whether homoiconicity is a property of a language, or of an implementation of a language.",1411305987
