Despite my OCD, it doesn&#x27;t bother me, and in fact, I prefer formatting them as below:<p><pre><code>    some_dict = {\n      &#x27;a_key&#x27;: an_expression,\n      &#x27;another_key&#x27;: another_expression,\n    }\n</code></pre>\nQuestion, if you add another entry, and it throws off the formatting, do you go up and change all the other entries prior so they all align? Because that does bring up questions about code-commits. I.e. you&#x27;re touching code that hasn&#x27;t changed.<p><pre><code>    some_dict = {\n      &#x27;a_key&#x27;: an_expression,\n      &#x27;another_key&#x27;: another_expression,\n      &#x27;a_really_long_key_that_throws_you_off&#x27;: expression,\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAs opposed to:<p><pre><code>    some_dict = {&#x27;a_key&#x27;:                                 an_expression,\n                 &#x27;another_key&#x27;:                           another_expression,\n                 &#x27;a_really_long_key_that_throws_you_off&#x27;: expression}</code></pre>",1428051573

The Basques and Catalans would have a viable case for independence if they could be EU members and most Western nations are founded on the principle of self-determination.

That is a question for the Basque and Catalan people. But a modern, moral, Western country would at least allow a binding referendum, as the UK has done in Scotland and as Canada did in Quebec. If Catalonia has a referendum and they choose to stay part of Spain, that is their choice. But the Spanish government refuses to grant them that choice.",1428048399

I can&#x27;t imagine there would be such a large objection, and as a rule in my experience with Germans (the largest EU economy by a large margin, followed by the UK), they are proud English speakers, and English is a requirement for serious business or political participation.  Germany and the UK would almost certainly be all right with federal English, and together account for 39% of the EU economy.  The French (third-largest) have different feelings but I doubt that they would object to the simple fact of their leaders speaking English at the federal level.  Just Germany, France, and UK, together account for 55% of the EU economy.  Smaller countries would have more trouble adapting, but, really, how many leaders need to be involved at the &#x27;federal&#x27; level?  Local government can, of course, remain in its own language.
