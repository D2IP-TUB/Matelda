7056342,comment,7050319,7050319,5,0,MrMeker,,,"I am in between high school and college right now on a bit of an unplanned gap year. Coming out of school, I figured it would be easy to get a job in technology, programming, welding, machining, glassblowing, or some other hobby of mine. It wasn&#x27;t.<p>I turned in applications to many different businesses, telling each one that I would &quot;add value&quot; to their company. I was laughed out of a computer repair shop, told that in my rural area, it is impossible to find tech jobs.<p>The first place that called me back was McDonald&#x27;s. I told them that I would take the job, but then Taco Bell also responded. Taco Bell was closer to my house, so I called McDonald&#x27;s and told them sorry, but I had a better offer.<p>I worked two shifts at Taco Bell, proud in my uniform, making tacos and burritos as fast as I could, before a local hardware store invited me in for an interview. After passing a drug test, I was working in retail. Hardware, building real things and the like is a passion of mine. I started at $8.50/hr, better than minimum wage. The hours piled up fast, and before I knew what was going on, my bank account had 4 digit numbers on the statements.<p>My mom also helped me get another job at the restaurant where she works. I washed dishes. Me, with a 4.9 GPA, selected as &quot;Super Student of the County&quot; or some award I can&#x27;t even remember, was elbows deep in dirty water for 8 hours a night after a 6 hour shift selling nuts, bolts, and brooms. It was hard work, I could barely stand after unloading the dishwasher for the last time, mopping the floors, taking out the trash, polishing the glasses and silverware, locking up, and driving home.<p>This may sound like it&#x27;s beneath you because &quot;you can code&quot;. So can I. But working for minimum wage at one job and barely above at the other, I made about $100/day, not counting tips from the restaurant (which have since payed for a new laptop) and before taxes.<p>I met some great people at the hardware store, and although I had to give it up when I took a few math and language classes at the local college, I loved it. I still work at the restaurant and I am typing this after a shift. My arms smell like funky dishwater and my feet still hurt. But I worked six hours today for $48, and probably $40 in tips. I don&#x27;t know about you, but $14/hr is good pay for unskilled labor, even though I can hack or code. I could give freelancing a try, but I am pretty sure it would end in the failure this echo chamber loves so much. Instead, every other Saturday I take home a paycheck and deposit it on Sunday. If I decide to pick up my floor where I throw my tips at the end of the night, I am rewarded with a few hundred dollars. This will easily pay for gas and other expenses. A large portion goes to savings for my next 4 year which will be largely income-free. The leftovers go wherever I want. I decided to learn electronics, so I bought an arduino and some components for about $100. 6 months ago I couldn&#x27;t have imagined going to Radio Shack and laying 5 Jackson&#x27;s on the counter to walk out with something that fits in the palm of my hand and will let out the &quot;magic smoke&quot; if I mix up GND and RAW.<p>The majority of comments have told you to build your portfolio and find pain points of businesses around you. Instead, I urge you to find a job, be it at a McDonald&#x27;s or a 5-star cafe. Perhaps at a Walmart. You are young and you don&#x27;t need to work for a living wage.<p>I used to think that the only thing I would have to do with my hands after school was type. Now, I scrub dishes. But I also have 35 hours a week where I am forced to be away from HN, Facebook, and Reddit. I get to shoot the shit with my coworkers or daydream about how we are all machines behind an elastic load balancer and if anyone of us were to cut our hand off, the kitchen would experience a cascading failure and it would be a very long night.<p>My job provides structure to my life, something I am terrified I will lose next year when I go across the country to be a freshman again. It also has a guaranteed income of $8/hr. Tips are good. The meal at the end of each night is great.<p>Instead of spending hours hounding LinkedIn, Fiverr, or ODesk, I drive 12 miles and put on nonslip shoes. It&#x27;s easy, it pays well, but most of all, its fun.<p>My advice: bootstrap your career with the MVP of jobs: anything with regular hours. Pay doesn&#x27;t matter as the hours will melt away. I would stay away from programming or IT for minimum wage, as that will probably poison your passion for computers.",1389696632

7056313,comment,7055226,7056243,3,0,kamaal,,,"To think of a human body as human is really a wrong way to look at it. To know why, ask yourself this question-- are people who have no limbs, hands or can&#x27;t see or hear human? Our hands, legs, skins well nearly every thing in our bodies are more or less non intelligent entities at best serving as sensor inputs and bio-mechanical parts which move things around, which give inputs and receive inputs from the brain.<p>Human bodies are the very same, which is what enables development of medical science as a general discipline. So is the human brain. Yet! The data in our brains which your gather by experience seems to vastly alter the individual nature of individual humans. All this combined together you can likely download the &#x27;data&#x27; + &#x27;meta files&#x27; in your brain someday.<p>>>If we transfer our minds into the &quot;cloud&quot; then are we still human?<p>Yes, Why would you doubt that. Lets do a simple experiment. Say you sleep today night. Without your knowledge some one just removes your brain and implants an exact electronic replica of it which resembles your brain as is. Your brain is simply receiving signals from your body. So will you notice any change when you wake up? Lets continue the experiment further, say the next day that electronic brain was removed and just connected to a simulator which will simulate your body as your know it and the world around you. When you get up the next day in the morning(in the simulator) will you know if you are even in a simulator?<p>The whole point is you need to learn this concept that you are not your body, and your neural computer + software just lives within a biological body. Someday that meta information and data can just be taken out and everything else that acts as an input to it can be simulated.<p>>>Are we even alive?<p>Define alive? Alive is only your biological body able to continue to support your neural self further. Death is the opposite.<p>>>Are they cared for by robots that we control within the cloud?<p>Within the cloud, your meta information + your currently gathered information through life experience stays intact. Your new software brain(imagine it like a VM) can be fed inputs that simulate whatever world you want. Want heaven? Hell? Well whatever your want they can simulate it for you.<p>You can see this even now, Most of us lucid dream. This is just an extension of that.<p>>>And if our body dies, then what?<p>The concept of a biological body doesn&#x27;t exist anymore. You will have better hardware to run on.<p>>>And those &quot;humans&quot; inside the AI would no longer be human.<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t they be?",1389695902

Granted I don&#x27;t go for stretches longer than about 45 minutes, and I do it every morning when the cleaning has just happened. Or perhaps you&#x27;d need a specific additional technique apart from just sitting focusing on breathing. Visualisation techniques can sometimes dramatically change the effect of a meditation session (sometimes, but not consistently).<p>Additionally, I suggest trying to meditate when you&#x27;re mildly sleep deprived. You&#x27;ll find it harder to do, with yourself dozing off or blinking/blacking out occasionally. And while they&#x27;re both, in some sense, mental states of &quot;no thought&quot;, they are also worlds apart: the meditative state is a state of high focus, while the dozing/blinked state is pretty much the opposite.<p>What I&#x27;ve found in the few occasions I&#x27;ve experienced this (I don&#x27;t like being sleep deprived so I try to avoid it :) ), is that you come out of such a blink-out state with a tiny bit of a jolt. Now, say I&#x27;d apply the same technique as one would use for basic meditation practice: when your thoughts wander away, try to observe that this has happened, congratulate yourself on noticing (instead of seeing it as failure) and gently bring your thoughts back to the focus.<p>Now I guess (and I&#x27;d have to try it out, but I don&#x27;t want to because it involved sleep-depriving myself) one of two things will happen: One, over time (weeks/months), this process will train myself not to fall asleep, setting up circuits in my brain to keep me from dozing off (hopefully only when I don&#x27;t want to). Of course the cleaning thing won&#x27;t happen because you&#x27;re awake and focused all the time, so you just got more efficient at sleep depriving yourself. OR number two, perhaps more likely, you&#x27;ll doze off anyway, at some point. I can totally see that happen, dozing off into a half-dream where I dream I bring my mind back into focus and have this amazing meditation, suddenly get weird, in my dreams, and wake up a few hours later. It&#x27;s the typical kind of trick my brain would pull on me.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t quite see meditation like this. True, after 30 mins of meditating I am usually more relaxed and focused than I was before (but not always), but the main thing about meditation for me is just like sports and exercise: it&#x27;s not so much about the immediate results, but it&#x27;s <i>training</i>. When I meditate I do it because I am training my mind to keep focus and not drift off to everywhere except here & now, to have that state at least once a day, but to also take that habit onto the rest of the day when I&#x27;m not sitting. What you&#x27;re describing sounds more like meditation as a kind of &quot;pill&quot; to give a direct effect, I find it&#x27;s not very reliable in that sense, I use it more like training one&#x27;s back muscles to give more support during the day.",1389694949
