While the same number of pixels still need to be rendered overall, some data structure  possibly the whole scene database, or maybe just a display list, if results are good enough without stepping the internal simulation to the time of each block  still has to be traversed once per block to determine what to draw.<p>You could do a pretty simple hack though, that might be good enough: Render the frame onto a buffer, as usual, but instead of displaying it, re-render it using beam-racing with the proper rotation around the viewer to counter the latency of the rendering and transfer time.<p>This would be a bit like how Google Streetview interpolates the panoramas when you move, but very much simplified, since you only correct for rotation.<p>Edit: Fixed the ""ream-racing"" typo.",1356877324

On a daily basis I review my goals for the day.  On a semi-random basis I review my goals for other random-lengths of time.  Usually triggered by passing through or letting go of another goal on my roadmap.  Meanwhile on a fairly regular basis I review my personal ""core goals"" and see if my current progress and goals are in alignment.  If they're not I either rework my core goals or rework my ""working"" goals to align.  Sometimes I do this on the subway to work and other times on a beach while on vacation.<p>I think setting goals at the beginning of the year really has no impact on the reality of your life.  That said it's not a bad idea to look at your ""core"" goals.  Rather then say ""I'll loose 25 lbs this year"" say ""I want to be healthy for the rest of my life"". And then identify some short, mid and long term goals to obtain that overall ""core goal"".<p>Often if I find myself overwhelmed by life I will stop and review my ""core goals"" and make sure everything is in alignment with those.  Or I change them to meet what I really want in my life ""now"".  When I was younger I had very different ""core goals"" then I do now and I'm comfortable that sometime in the next 0 to 24 months those might change as I review what is meaningful and rewarding to me in my life.<p>As an example my primary goal is to ""Live my life in my passion"".  This has actually been true for most of my life starting sometime while I was in high school.  Clearly my ""passion"" has changed over time but the ""core goal"" remains the same and drives many of my decisions in my life.<p>That said some other ""core goals"" of mine have changed though my life as I've progressed through various phases and transitions in my life.  Your ""core goals"" when you have young children are most likely very different then when they've all moved out and are living their own lives. :-)<p>Be flexible, be alert and true to yourself, find your ""core goals"" and then develop your short, mid and long-term goals driven from those.  And as always, be willing to change them as you and your life changes.",1356876769

The algorithm could also be ""Use your own coin flip and then guess the opposite of your own result"" and the probabilities would be the same, ie. 50%.<p>Give the fact that you have a 50% chance of losing $2 and a 50% chance of winning $1, this is not a game that C should play, since the expected value is -$0.50.",1356876098
