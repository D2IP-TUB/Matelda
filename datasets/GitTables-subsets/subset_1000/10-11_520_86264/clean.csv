Just swapping out Linux kernel with a FreeBSD one doesn&#x27;t quite work.<p>Well, actually that&#x27;s the heart of the problem right there. Systemd mangles and complects things. You <i>can</i> replace the kernel (see Debian/kfreebsd and to a lesser extent Illumos). Or you can make a &quot;distro&quot; like cygwin/mingw et al for windows and homebrew for os x. Because there are some more or less well defined interfaces between userland and kernel space.

8354747,comment,8353006,8354651,2,0,vidarh,,,"Sounds familiar..<p>One of my &quot;favourite&quot; problems with init scripts for service stop/start is that way too many of them basically throws their hands up if the contents of the pid-file doesn&#x27;t match what it expects. Never mind that 90% of the time when I want to actually run stop/start/restart, it is because something has crashed or is misbehaving, and there&#x27;s a high likelihood the pid file does not reflect reality.<p>So a far too common scenario is: Process dies. Tries to run &quot;start&quot;. Nothing happens, because the pid-file exists and the script doesn&#x27;t verify that the pid actually matches a running process (or it checks that it matches a running process, but not that the process with that pid is actually what we want).<p>Ok, so we try &quot;restart&quot; or &quot;stop&quot;. Gets an error, because the pid-file content does not match a running process, and rather than then cleaning out the pid file and starting the process, it just bails.<p>Basically I don&#x27;t trust init scripts from anyone but distro maintainers themselves, and even then there are often plenty of edge cases that cause problems.<p>Regardless of systemd, I really like the systemd solution to this of using cgroups to ensure it can keep proper track of exactly which processes belongs to a service without resorting to brittle pid-files which seem to rarely be properly implemented. Of course that cgroups approach could be implemented as a separate tool, but pid-files badly needs to die.",1411468750

Then I ended up running Debian, with newfangled Grub.  I needed to change some kernel parameter (IIRC) but all I could find was a mess of undocumented scripts which say &quot;don&#x27;t touch this&quot;.  I don&#x27;t know where the documentation went, and it seemed needlessly complicated to configure.  Why couldn&#x27;t I say <i>man grub</i> and learn all I need about it?  I had other issues with Debian, but the last straw was when during a routine package update it decided to install a new version of Grub.. and the next time, it wouldn&#x27;t boot anymore.  Why was it so complicated in the first place?  Why did Debian have to fix it if it&#x27;s not broken?  Why did it fail to do it right?  I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t really care... all I know is that needless complexity and churn caused trouble, again.<p>So I&#x27;m no longer using Grub or Debian.  And my bootloader is simple.  I&#x27;ve installed it once, and never touched it afterwards.  It&#x27;s possible to configure it a little, but there&#x27;s no need for it.  So what if it has fewer features.

It&#x27;s not there yet, but the right solution for managing this declaratively as with anything else on a Unix platform is Ansible/salt/cfengine or something like that, not building those tools into a superset service that manages everything.<p>I will also add that managing disparate platforms is never a reality from experience.

But those patches would be rejected; the Gnome project has decided to use systemd and would not want to duplicate its code. If I were to maintain my own gnome fork I would have to convince distributions to adopt it.<p>I could write patches that add FreeBSD support to systemd. But those patches would be rejected - again, as a policy decision, systemd doesn&#x27;t want to support FreeBSD. Thankfully in this case there is a fork, uselessd, but again, we need to convince distributions to adopt it or it&#x27;s meaningless.<p>The claim that Gnome &quot;independently&quot; relies on systemd is specious; there was a lot of lobbying and politics from the systemd side. My only practical option is to counter at the same level, and lobby Gnome (and linux distributions) to make the political decision to move away from systemd.",1411467632

That new thing in freebsd 10?) is (the possibility of) full resource accounting/limitation. Go ahead run you pi-digit-finder at &quot;100%&quot; cpu, pipe /dev/zero over an ssh pipe to /dev/null on some box and pipe it to a local file as well: no other vm or the host will notice. You only get 1mbs, x cycles of cpu and x mb of disk.<p>Secondly, assuming a bug in the kernel, one might assume root in a container can lead to root on the host. Bsd jails have been pretty solid for the last few years afaik - but hardware support for virtualization might still get more of both separation/safety <i>and</i> speed. There have been som bad bugs in (as i recall) the io system in xen, leading to similar issues ... but again the last time i saw anything on that was years ago.<p>Ymmv - generally docker doesn&#x27;t have &quot;run untrusted code, safely, as root&quot; as a design-goal (yet, afaik) (not entirely sure about lxc, nÃ©e vserver -- the underlying technology) -- so don&#x27;t expect it to do that.
