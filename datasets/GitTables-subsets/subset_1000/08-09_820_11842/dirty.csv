9829676,comment,9828507,9829589,0,0,anotherevan,,,"I really disliked the that Dune miniseries[1]. There was some really awful acting and very cheap looking sets through a lot of it.<p>I also thought they got the tone of Paul&#x27;s character completely wrong. To me he came across starting off as an arrogant thug whereas my perception of him from the books was a very thoughtful if not perhaps demonstratively emotive young man. (Obviously subjective viewpoint, but it put me off right from the start.)<p>OTOH, the audiobook produced by Audible I thought was very good. I&#x27;ve probably read the book four or five times, the last time well over a decade ago. I listened to the audiobook recently and really enjoyed it and reminded me how much I liked the first book[2].<p>[1] Have not seen the Children of Dune miniseries.<p>[2] I&#x27;m in the &quot;first book was good, the rest was crap&quot; camp.

You can generalize both operations to &quot;process component when building the component tree&quot;.<p>Each time you add an item to a list of size n, it needs to process the previous n items. This forms the series 1+2+...+(n-1)+n, which is (n^2+n)/2.<p>Obviously a reference comparison is a lot quicker than a render, so you get big speed wins using immutablejs that are definitely worth it, but it&#x27;s still O(n^2) components processed.",1436000101

9829656,comment,9827051,9828776,0,0,lmm,,,"I find the way it works in scala very nice - a block is just an expression that evaluates to the last statement in the block, and idiomatic code never uses &quot;return&quot; anywhere. Even e.g. a function definition, you can replace the block with a single expression if it&#x27;s more convenient. I agree with being explicit but I don&#x27;t think return actually makes things any more explicit (if you&#x27;re talking about an editor highlighting, the editor knows which line is the value of the block, with or without a &quot;return&quot;) - rather it&#x27;s just syntactic ceremony.

It&#x27;s a fantasy-scify with deep and complex characters and complex interactions. Normally you&#x27;d start to see a scifi universe break apart after a few books, but Dune&#x27;s could stand, it&#x27;s &#x27;realistic&#x27; in a sense.<p>If you mean the sequels, prequels, interquels made by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson, then those are of a lower quality. They had the good fortune to inherit an IP and just ran with it. They may not be so bad as far as the genre goes (except for Sandworms), but they create a somewhat wider context.

Oh, and you could have eliminated that &#x27;ins&#x27; variable.",1435997667

I am not talking about only that Spiegel incident when I ask if you followed the news. There is a large uproar within the german people about what has been uncovered so far regarding dragnet surveillance, surveillance of politicians and now journalists.<p>I do not know the chances but I do hope that there will be more light what happened between the BND and the NSA. And I also hope that some folks at the BND will be put to jail for what they allowed to happen on german soil.<p>I am not nitpicking words. I do not disagree that banks have a different relationship, no. I see that as well. But I also see and accept that corps as well as private persons can settle out of court. (Thas has nothing to do with a plea deal). Settling out of court mostly is done on private terms, i.e. money or patents or whatever exchanges hands, where I think a plea deal is more about going to jail for less than what would be at risk with a trial.",1435997299

The code generator would run before every compile and its output would be fed straight into the compiler.

So we could restrict the kinds of things that CPP can do to make it more predictable. Let&#x27;s say CPP can only substitute symbols in places where types are asked for...",1435997224

I contacted the authors - one replied that he can&#x27;t reveal the source code, and the other didn&#x27;t reply.

In rural areas it can be more cost effective to just do direct burial fiber.<p>Fiber strands are also quite cheap. It is often faster, cheaper and easier to direct bury a fiber cable with &quot;enough&quot; fiber strands to cater for current and any forseeable demand than to install a condiit system in rural areas.<p>Furthermore it is quite rare to replace the fiber in a last mile network. I can&#x27;t recall a single instance since single mode fiber was introduced. It just isn&#x27;t cost effective. It&#x27;s much easier, cheaper and faster to just change the electronics/optics.<p>Even adding more fiber strands by means of a new cable is rare. Again it just isn&#x27;t cost effective. It&#x27;s much easier, cheaper and faster to just change the electronics/optics. Even so, in rural areas it is just cheaper to plow down another cable than to build a conduit network.<p>In summary, a conduit system is more expensive to install, repair and maintain than a direct burial network. Aerial systems are generally even cheaper, but have their own downsides.<p>A direct burial network might not be as flexible and easily upgradeable as a conduit system, but sometimes this does not matter, especially if you are on a fixed budget.",1435996995
