851408,comment,851287,851396,0,0,kingsley_20,,,"Right now, if I wanted to found a startup without taking some of the risks Sharan took (the LLC route), I'd have to get enough funding to pay myself ~70K/year as salary. Then, and if I had respectable funding, and some well known/ respectable people on the board, I can set up shop and have a US Citizen co-founder ""hire"" me as an H1B.<p>So the system as it stands <i>forces</i> immigrant founders to raise funding, even if you had a completely bootstrappable business plan. That's where the bar is set now, and it definitely dissuades people, and that's why I think many of us advocate lowering it. Substitute it with education, experience or endorsements maybe?",1254261506

Does a company with (what looks like) 4 people and a few seed investors count as a startup?  This seems like a really low bar.  I think pg's initial essay kind of glosses over the difficulty of defining a startup - or for that matter even a ""startup investor"".<p>I go both ways on this issue.  I think letting smart, driven people into the US to work is awesome.  But I'm not sold that being the founder of a ""startup"" is the right bar.",1254261036

For example, I thought of the same basic idea as the AfterTheDeadline software, around the same time. I didn't implement it, but someone else did, to great success.  Why didn't I do it?  I couldn't think of how I could sell it, or who would even use it.<p>Of course, I applaud the success of AfterTheDeadline.

You still need to define types for ADTs, and those can change early on. I think the bigger benefit to inferred static typing is during maintenance, ensuring that the design is still internally consistent.<p>I mostly agree with you, and have the same experience about TDD vs. type inference. I'm not dogmatic about TDD either, though - I use a REPL and asserts, and sometimes QuickCheck-ish tools for testing during the initial writing.",1254260933

As a Campfire user, I'm sure you understand how important persistent group chat is to your organization. Unfortunately, most people aren't like you (yet)! We think there is a lot of room in this space, because more and more companies will realize how useful apps like ours are over the next few years. It's a relatively young, growing market.<p>Aside from that, there are a lot of improvements yet to be made in order to polish the group chat experience. One thing that we do, for example, is to allow users to sit in multiple rooms and be notified immediately about activity in background rooms. If you have more than one team using your account, that quickly becomes very important. That's just an example of one cool feature we've already implemented. We're still in beta, so there's a ton yet to come from us.<p>Thanks for checking it out.",1254258942

From what btilly said, it seems that the frustration occurred before they received their final grades because they didn't realize that the grading system was going to be fair.  They expected to be graded relative to each other (on a curve), with A's going to a certain, pre-fixed percent of the class.  Instead, everyone who did well got an A for their good work.  I think the complaint was about the demoralizing effects of the erroneous assumptions during the semester, not about the grades themselves.",1254258445

I tend to work in areas with strong network effects, so tens of millions in funding or profits is really nothing.  It doesn't affect our strategy at all.  We usually just have to be wary of the true behemoths (Google, Nokia, Microsoft, etc.) that can wield enough force to actually change the market.<p>On the other hand, we sometimes also have to be wary of the tiny, unprofitable startups that have gotten enormous mindshare in the market for some reason.  This, of course, is relatively rare  - but it happens.  The majority of companies are in the middle of that spectrum, and they're the ones that tend to piss away millions without affecting us in any way whatsoever.  Except maybe for pointless patent skirmishes.  I <i>hate</i> the US patent system with a red-hot glowing passion that knows no bounds.",1254258403
851327,comment,849726,851250,0,0,kscaldef,,,"Well, this is why I mentioned TDD.  People (maybe not you) don't have a problem with their tests failing right away, and having to fix the test to go forward.  In fact, they call it a feature!  But when the compiler _proves_ you have a bug, somehow that is too odious.<p>The other thing with a type-inferring compiler is that you don't have to figure out all your types upfront.  You don't have to declare any types at all (usually).  If everything is good, the compiler doesn't complain.  As soon as you start to make an error, it tells you.  Personally, I use the compiler very much like TDD advocates use tests.  Write a function, make sure it compiles, slowly build up the whole program.  If I wait until I've written the whole program before I run the type-checker, it's likely to be pretty ugly.  Better to catch the errors quickly when it's less work to correct them.",1254258400

Perhaps we can speculate that the difference between a successful charter city and industrialized world cities is too small to be worth it. I'd still like to see this in Massachusetts, but let's accept the premise.<p>Then perhaps a developing nation like any one of the East European states, I'm originally form one of those and would LOVE something like that. Too bad no present government in that area will let it happen. But think of all the benefits, why not? Because again, if the people in charge acted rationally according to economically beneficial facts we'd already have economically booming cities.<p>Even in Greece, the Mogadishu scenario would be the good outcome, not that EU human rights laws and what not would ever let it go that bad, but then at least people could be deported. But the bad scenario is success, now you have a bunch of economically successful foreigner on <i>your home soil</i>! The next best thing would be high taxes, the most likely next thing would be much worse and typical of Balkan history.<p>And the sad thing is this has been done. Mainland China did it with it's economic free zones, what now 20-30 years ago? And it has been spectacularly successful. So everybody's rushing to copy this, right?<p>Well India is dipping its toes in it. very slowly with tiny zones, and they are not nearly as un-regulated as they could be, but at least it's something. The only other example I can think of is actually North Korea, where because of Kim's train's tours of booming China, some tiny tiny faintly capitalist zones have been set up. And that's about it.<p>Best of luck to the effort, but I just think it's so naively idealistic, childish almost.",1254258321
