We know this because it was on that date that Apple published a note in his name announcing that they were going to allow third party apps and that the SDK would be available by February 2008 [1].<p>At that date in the Android world, Android only existed as an alpha within Google, and had not yet even been officially announced. It wasn&#x27;t announced until the first beta, November 5, 2007. The first Android SDK was released November 12, 2007.<p>By the end of the first weekend that the Apple App Store was available, they had 10 million downloads from real customers. By that weekend in the Android world, there were 0 apps in the hands of real customers.

8343637,story,,,1,5,reallycurious,"Ask HN: What could be putting limit on user engagement?",,"My SaaS product extracts data from pdf files. Free trial gets users 10 free extractions. Paying users get 100 jobs. User logs into dashboard, uploads pdf, and downloads the extracted data. That is one job.<p>While observing 50 users so far I notice that the user engagement seems to terminate after they run the job for the first time. Even if it is successful. Some users run it a few more times but the result is the same, they leave and never come back or they come back run a job and leave again. Another observation is that 30 out of 50 users never created any jobs (they must label the pdf using the web app before extraction can happen, I explain how to do it in the demo video).<p>Even reaching out to all 50 users asking if I could help them, I got one reply. Here&#x27;s what one of my user said<p>&quot;Give that your subscription packages allow customers to run a certain number of jobs, it’d be important to me as a customer to know that I don’t waste jobs trying to figure out what data are captured every time and refining the same job until I get it right. &quot;<p>Is limiting the free trial to 10 jobs per user be the cause of engagement terminating after running a few jobs? I reached out to the user to see how they would respond to having no limits.<p>Are people having trouble with just figuring out how to use the tool evidence by a over 60% inactivity? Whats more frustrating is that they do not respond to my email queries where I ask them if they need help.<p>I would like to study more about user engagements and creating a business model that will get users to engage with the product in order to reach a key activation metric to find value in the product.",1411185308

8343615,comment,8341017,8341838,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Your description why unions don&#x27;t work is in fact the explanation why unions organize workers across different employers.<p>That doesn&#x27;t work when the employer&#x27;s market has low entry barriers and the employees have low skills. As soon as you unionize all the existing employers you get a new employer hiring non-union employees and putting all the union employers out of business by charging lower prices.<p>> Your description why cheap labor will skip out on the unions is in fact the explanations why unions make economic sense for its members. You earn more in them than out of them.<p>It&#x27;s not the union employees who go to work for the non-union employers. It&#x27;s the unemployed. Until the non-union employers charging lower prices cause the union employers to lay off workers or go out of business, at which point the previously union employees become the unemployed and go work for the non-union employer since they can no longer work for the union employer.<p>> Organized labor creates a level playing field across markets, simply because they have a shared interest with the unionized companies that they thrive and provide work for its members. It is a natural part of a healthy free market.<p>Organized labor is an attempt to create a cartel of workers to balance a cartel of employers.

Even if using Apache in the now quite old prefork MPM, it is a process pool, rather than a process-per-connection that you&#x27;ve described, and is not subject to the performance problems you&#x27;re alleging (memory usage can be high when using that MPM for high concurrency workloads, but its performance in most deployments is not all that bad).<p>Further, &quot;forking processes&quot; is actually <i>not</i> incredibly expensive on Linux, and in fact, pthreads on Linux are implemented by the same code (clone() with varying levels of sharing). Forked applications on Linux are pretty much just as fast as threaded applications. It is a myth based on extremely outdated knowledge (fork on Solaris, for instance, and some other UNIX variants, had a history of being slow; but, Linux has always had a very fast fork).<p>It is true that event-based thread (or process) pool concurrency implementations can provide superior performance to thread- or process-per-connection implementations, for a variety of reasons, but Apache has that covered. I&#x27;m gonna guess you&#x27;ve never even used or seen an Apache installation that forked a process for every request (because it&#x27;s been so long since that was a thing Apache did), so I&#x27;m not sure how you could believe it works that way.<p>Where did you get all of these assertions from? Are there sites out there propagating these crazy claims about Apache? And, if so, why? What does one gain by trash-talking a project that was instrumental in helping build the open web and still powers more websites than any other web server in the world? And, does it well, I might add. There are some good reasons a reasonable admin might choose nginx over Apache. But, they aren&#x27;t because Apache is a terrible piece of software written by incompetent people.<p>In short, your comment has negative value, by providing misleading and outright incorrect information.<p>Edit: And, this is why I hate it when performance is the measuring stick people use to discuss web servers. It begins to seem like it is a useful metric for comparing web servers, when it really is not for 99% (or more) of deployments. Apache is fast enough. nginx is fast enough. Pick your web server based on other characteristics, because otherwise you&#x27;re almost certainly making decisions based on the wrong things.",1411183532

I still feel like this article focuses on the wrong thing. It&#x27;s equivocating Landau notation (Big O) with complexity/efficiency, but never explains what complexity is. It then proceeds to link this to the efficiency of code under certain circumstances. While this work gives a couple of examples as to how to determine the &quot;big O&quot; of simple algorithms, it ignores its meaning and context. This is a huge mistake.<p>First off, big O notation wasn&#x27;t created with complexity theory or algorithms in mind. If I recall correctly, it has its roots in complex analysis. The notation was later borrowed as computational complexity was formalized. What happened is that people needed a way to describe the hardness or &quot;logical sophistication&quot; of problems and tasks. Looking into the asymptotic behavior of a complexity measure was just one means that they used. There are plenty of other ways to do this. The article reads like big O exists for the purpose of complexity analysis of algorithms. I doubt the author intended this, but they should be a bit more careful.<p>Time and space aren&#x27;t the only resources of interest. Sometimes you need to quantify how much information you have or how much entropy there is. If you want to understand &quot;what is basically happening&quot;, this is something you should pay attention to. Are we handling more information than we have to? What do we need and not need? Circuit sizes, sophistication of proofs, setups of databases, and the complexity of communications/protocols also play a role.<p>Even ignoring all this, the article is missing an elementary half of the picture: the structure of the input. It&#x27;s not just about code and its design. Data structures matter, too. How information is organized, how it is encoded, and how it can be manipulated (computed on) makes an absolute huge difference. Are things sorted or unsorted? What kind of list or tree structure is your code working with? From what I understand, this is the whole point of a significant chunk of the interview questions candidates are presented with. It&#x27;s ridiculous to omit this when introducing algorithmic complexity.<p>The author claims that Big O notation is an &quot;awesome, not-boring kind of math where you get to wave your hands through the details and just focus on what&#x27;s basically happening&quot;. They are hand waving not just the math, but also hand waving (and ignoring) most of the context as well. It doesn&#x27;t even directly explain why big O notation models code efficiency in a fruitful way. It just mentions run time and memory usage superficially. In my opinion, this needs to be significantly revised or rewritten.",1411182741

It sounds like you&#x27;re suggesting that for any costly responsibility placed on employers, there will always be a laborer willing to work without it. Ok, sure. There are also surely families who would be willing to send their children to work in a mine. But that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.<p>The problem is people want to pretend that the choices they&#x27;re making are not trade offs when they are.<p>You can&#x27;t give the drivers a 50% raise and expect the money to come from Uber when Uber is taking 20% and have their own expenses. So the money has to come from passengers. But that violates the narrative of the evil corporation oppressing the poor workers. The passengers are mostly regular working class people. Transferring wealth to the working class from the working class is hardly social justice. Meanwhile supply and demand is still in operation so when the cost of rides go up the demand goes down, which means some of the drivers are going to lose their jobs and some of the passengers are going to try to drive home drunk.<p>The unions like to take credit for every good thing that came out of the 20th century, but the reason American kids today don&#x27;t work in the mines has less to do with labor laws and more to do with the fact that a) modern American mines and manufacturing are highly automated and b) American families no longer <i>need</i> to send their kids into the mines.<p>Which is exactly how the labor situation should be addressed. Automate every crappy job we can so nobody has to suffer them, then take part of the massive productivity enhancement that brings and use it to provide a basic income. The basic income allows people to turn down unreasonable working conditions without starving and to make a living with a job that has reasonable working conditions but low pay.",1411182715
