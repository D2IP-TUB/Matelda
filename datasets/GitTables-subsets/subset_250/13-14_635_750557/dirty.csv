Safari still sends cookies to iframes across domains.<p>Even if Safari blocked sending cookies to other domains, it would still be possible for both commenting and the like buttons to work.  On a low-tech level, rather than working by Ajax (which is how I assume they work - I haven't actually used them), they would work as a standard link or form to Facebook's site.  Once not in the iframe and on Facebook's site, it would realize that you were logged in and rather than asking you for your email and password would record the like or comment.  In fact, when you try to press a like button not logged in, a small window pops up asking for your email/pass so that it can log you in and do just that.  It's easy to imagine that the window would pop up, offer a little ""thank you for your comment"" confirmation with a close button.<p>Facebook could also decide that it wanted to use Flash cookies which would work if Safari blocked sending cookies to other domains.  Safari isn't in control of whether Flash is loaded in an iframe and a Flash cookie is requested from another domain.  This is part of the reason why it's more significant on the iOS platform.  Advertisers do use Flash a lot and that usage can be used to set a Flash cookie that the browser doesn't control and Flash doesn't have a setting to disallow Flash cookies from sites you don't visit.",1300629030

They don't say that the official reading are not credible, but let's take a few measurements to make sure.<p>Background radiation levels vary quite a bit due to surrounding geographical features. A reading from a government station is made under a controlled environment, so a prolonged and large increase in their readings is a good indicator of possible contributions from artificial sources. Getting people to run around with consumer radiation meters isn't going to produce credible data, especially when people are more likely to submit a sample if they ""find"" an unusual reading.<p>Also, they're calling for contributions from people in Japan.

Introverts generally make up the extreme ends of the population distribution in terms of being ""successful"", success being defined the way it is generally accepted.  On the other hand, extroverts are spread out much more evenly. For example,the CEO of a big corporation might be an introvert, but most of the middle level managers are extroverts. Then there are those introverts who find it difficult to move up in the management hierarchy, for one reason or the other.

For example, always keeping deadlines or finishing prior to them is a high indicator of someone being a J.
