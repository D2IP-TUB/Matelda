2346369,comment,2345552,2345601,0,0,bartonfink,,,"When someone makes extraordinary claims about the ""tyranny of extroverts"" and says that the 10 most innovative minds couldn't carry a conversation if it had handles, then I think that person has shown a critical research failure to miss Feynman. He's not exactly an obscure figure and he's an obvious counterpoint to this guy's flame.<p>As for the other points I mentioned, they arise because his entire thesis is based on unsubstantiated conjecture. His very thesis, ""society rewards extroverts"" seems sound, but he's not exploring any of the reasons for this. Maybe society rewards extroverts because society is, by definition, a group activity and people who enjoy group activities will tend to gain the favor of the group.<p>Maybe society rewards extroverts because without communication skills, no idea will ever leave the mind that thought it.  It's the human equivalent to the ""if a tree falls in the forest"" koan. Or maybe this guy is right, and society rewards extroverts because the bastards have it in for introverts and it's a tyrannical conspiracy. This guy jumps right to my last point. His justification? That society is run by extroverts to the detriment of thinking people everywhere.<p>He conflates extroversion, a defined psychological term meaning, roughly, the tendency to derive pleasure and energy from social interaction, with conversational skills. The two overlap but it doesn't take a great deal of insight to see the difference - one can have exceptional ""people skills"" without deriving pleasure or energy from them. I suspect that more than one of the D.C. extroverts he tried to skewer in his opening paragraph are, in fact, introverts who have simply developed their ability to communicate in an effort to get stuff done.<p>He then points out that there are people who prefer things to people, and that we should make room for them in society instead of fixing them. Guess what. There is already room for these people - as engineers. Nobody is hunting introverts down and shooting them in the street. We aren't having pogroms. Society has simply made a decision about what it values and has set the rules of the game, so to speak. If these thing-preferring people he mentions are smart enough, they'll figure that out and actually work on communication skills and being able to work as a team because that's how you get influence in society. Olin wants its alumni/ae to be successful and well-known after graduation, so it provides opportunities for students to develop these traits. No conspiracy there.<p>For myself, since you point out that I seem to want his blessing - I don't care about his conclusions. I actually agree with them to a degree, but I take issue with the sloppy thinking he takes to get there.<p>tl;dr - This guy jumps to unwarranted, overdramatic conclusions about society's preference for extroverts and makes huge leaps in logic to try to justify what is essentially just his opinion.",1300632325

2346358,comment,2344818,2345802,0,0,dspillett,,,"There is certainly some confirmation bias going on in these reports, but I must say I sometimes find walking away from the problem for a short while (looking at something else, taking a relaxed lunch instead of eating at desk, just nipping out for a few minutes of fresh air, or just chatting to a colleague about something related or otherwise) can work wonders.<p>Sometimes a relevant idea will just come to me while I'm away (I carry a pencil and bit of paper for such occurrences, as it is very annoying to get back to my desk and forget the beneficial train of thought!), sometimes I'll hit the problem from a slightly different angle when I get back and find success that way.<p>I think mainly the difference is usually stress. Forcing your mind to think about a particular problem can drive you into a mental rut in which you think the same things over and over and get nowhere, getting more irritated at your lack of getting anywhere as time goes on which creates more stress and makes matters worse. At times like that inspiration is less likely to strike (or be recognised when it does). Having time to ponder a problem, consciously or otherwise, can be very fruitful.<p>This fits in quite nicely with the idea that the sleep pattern we've evolved is as much about rearranging what we've learnt and experienced while awake as it is about anything else (like the brain's DBA taking time to run DBCC REINDEX on everything so our thinking is more efficient the next day).

The biggest benefit agencies seem to offer is initial screening, but it's also where they seem to fall down the most.  When a recruiter can't tell me anything more than ""MySQL, PHP, JavaScript"", they don't really understand the client's needs or the position involved.<p>I find that perhaps 1 in 10 or 15 calls I get from a recruiter involves someone with a clue.  Sometimes they know the tech and can talk about the client's architecture and needs, other times they will admit they're not technical, but they have had some dealings with the company directly (often for extended periods) and have a good idea about the type of person who would be a good fit.  But it's still rare that I'm talking to a recruiter who, imo, is actually providing some degree of service to the hiring company (let alone my side of the equation).<p>More companies might be able to 'go direct' without needing a recruiter, but many don't know how to sell their own company to a potential employee.  Money helps, certainly, and they'd be able to offer more if they weren't involving a recruiting agency, but it typically takes a committed involvement from the company to do the initial screening.<p>I used to think recruiters had <i>no</i> place, and that companies should always go direct.

It's fair to say that I learned most of what I know about syadmin stuff while hosted with Slicehost.<p>When Slicehost got bought out, I switched to their new parent RackSpace to get some experience with ""cloud"" stuff.

Neuroticism is more associated with social anxiety, poor social skills, and the like. From wikipedia:<p>""[Neuroticism] is an enduring tendency to experience negative emotional states. Individuals who score high on neuroticism are more likely than the average to experience such feelings as anxiety, anger, guilt, and depressed mood.[1] They respond more poorly to environmental stress, and are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. They are often self-conscious and shy, and they may have trouble controlling urges and delaying gratification. Neuroticism is associated with low emotional intelligence, which involves emotional regulation, motivation, and interpersonal skills.[2] It is also a risk factor for ""internalizing"" mental disorders such as phobia, depression, panic disorder, and other anxiety disorders (traditionally called neuroses).""",1300630964

In London 40K is a lot less attractive than in York (where I live and work) where it is probably very good, and in somewhere like Grimsby it might be considered particularly high. The cost and hassle of working in a particular place (i.e. either rent or property purchase prices, and/or the convenience/availability/cost of transport options, access to good social facilities, and so on) make a huge difference and vary by a surprising amount from place to place even within a relatively small country and this factors into what an acceptable salary is.
