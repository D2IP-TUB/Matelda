When people outsource intermediate parts this looks like an increase in productivity because fewer people in the US used to make the same product for less money.  However, if you look at the total man hours to produce a given product it may have significantly increased.<p><a href=""http://www.evolvingexcellence.com/blog/2006/12/american_manufa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evolvingexcellence.com/blog/2006/12/american_manu...</a>",1297083592
2188726,comment,2188692,2188692,0,0,ot,,,"> But you are already near to the I/O limit, what happens once you start writing a new file to rewrite the btree? The additional I/O can affect badly the performance of the btree.<p>I wonder if there are any benchmark that compare append-only + compaction vs. updates in-place (with a free list or something). To me it is not obvious why the second should be less I/O-intensive (for example, in-place does random writes while append-only is sequential).<p>Also, if persistence is done by checkpointing every n seconds (as far as I understand this will be the default behaviour) part of the compaction can be done in memory before committing the batch of the last n seconds worth of operations. In append-only, this can save a lot of I/O if the operations are on a small set of keys.<p>I think that Bitcask (<a href=""http://downloads.basho.com/papers/bitcask-intro.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://downloads.basho.com/papers/bitcask-intro.pdf</a>) uses a similar approach, with append-only storage.

2188658,comment,2188422,2188507,0,0,dkersten,,,"Having spent two and a half years of my life getting intimate with GSM-based (ie, not CDMA, though a lot of the protocol stack is the same) SMS messages (I worked for a company that did security, anti spam, anti fraud and other VAS systems (parental control, blacklist, SMS backup etc) for mobile operators)[1], I know a little bit about it. Admitedly I could tell you a lot more about the protocols used by SMS than its history<p>GSM networks consist of two signalling links: voice and control. The contol is used to, for example, set up or terminate voice calls. This meant that, in practice, the control signalling links were generally idle and so they piggy-backed SMS on it. I don't know anything about the 128 bytes, but the 160 characters comes from the 140 byte payload, when using the 7bit GSM default packed alphabet. I don't know the numbers offhand (been a year since I've worked there now), but quite possibly this is, indeed, the maximum packet size available, though there certainly is a large range of differently sized packets. In fact, a lot of things are piggy backed on the SMS payload. For example, when using concatenated messages (or binary data - there was a range of predefined things that are biggy-backed on SMS as ""user data""), the header telling the phone which message it is is placed at the start of the message payload (reducing the maximum characters per text by (I don't remember offhand anymore) ~6 octets. Of course, 160 characters only applies to the 7bit GSM default alphabet. SMS messages also support 8bit and 16bit payloads.<p>Mobile operators absolutely love SMS as it is probably the most expensive form of communication they offer.<p>Somebody else below mentioned ubiquitous internet as an SMS replacement. While I think its true for a lot of people in well built-up parts of the world (and who have a smart phone, a lot of people still don't), its certainly not global. Hell, even here in Ireland theres areas where cell phone reception is pretty bad, so while you might manage to send or receive text messages, if you want to go online you're out of luck. Other, poorer, parts of the world are even worse off. Actually, I remember one company at the 2009 GSMA Mobile World Congress in Barcelona was demonstrating a solar panel powered mobile cell tower, for use in places like Africa, which was designed to provide better coverage of mainly SMS to large open spaces.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dublindan.posterous.com/things-ive-worked-on-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dublindan.posterous.com/things-ive-worked-on-4</a> We did a lot using transparent Home Routing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_home_routing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_home_routing</a> The wikipedia article says that transparent home oruting is limited. I disagree. At least in the lab, we implemented everything from the technical realization (and then some) on a transparent home routing system. I believe when I left the company, others were working on a non-transparent version too (because it is easier/cheaper to get and install hardware for non-transparent operation than for transparent). But then, we did a lot of non-standard things, we just did them in ways that don't interfere with the rest of the network.<p>EDIT: comment didn't end up as interesting as it sounded in my head.

No, no wait.  why should we care about Windows developers?  If they're still stuck there most likely they are deeply committed to the Microsoft Visual Studio toolset, in which case they don't (or can't) care about what goes on in the rest of the universe, and they really don't matter.  (By which of course I mean that as <i>fellow human beings</i> they matter, and of course I have sympathy for their suffering, but by their own choice they are locked in such an impregnable ivory tower that it is neither practical nor economic to try to break in and rescue them)<p>Other than that, who else uses Windows?  Oh yes, you have corporate teams doing 'enterprise' Java.  They'll typically be using some colossally retarded Ant build system that takes 7-30 <i></i>minutes<i></i> to run (sadly, I'm not even exaggerating for dramatic effect).  The problem with Ant is it is so easy to just bolt on 'one more thing' that it rapidly evolves to some horrible beast of a thing that lumbers around sucking everything into it, Katamari Damacy style.  Really, there's no help for them either.  You can't for example suggest that blowing away the entire database and recreating it from scratch in order to run the entire set of automated unit tests is something best left to the continuous integration server, or that should be done once a day - maybe out of hours or at lunchtime.  No no, it has to be done every time you do a build.  And that doesn't even touch on the ginormous mess that is the enterprise components, where each application server has its own arcane and unholy rituals to create its beans from the blood of unicorns and tears of virgin developers... try messing with that abomination and you're in for a world of pain.  There's just no helping them either, though in their case usually they want to be helped, but they are captive to the primary problem of enterprise development, which is that the people who choose technologies and mandate tools and processes are usually so far removed from the actual use of those tools as to be completely immune to the pain, and unable or unwilling to hear the wailing and gnashing of teeth of the programmers.<p>Don't even get me started on checkstyle with rules like no line can be longer than 80 characters (despite there being absolutely no good reason for this other than the horrible horrible UI of eclipse - in the absence of that you can easily get way more than 80 characters on the screen).<p><i>twitch</i>",1297080208
