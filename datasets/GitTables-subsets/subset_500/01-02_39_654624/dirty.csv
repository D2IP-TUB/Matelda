I think RWH and the Typeclassopedia are easier for the uninitiated to understand.  (""You could have invented monads"" is also very good.  Although I think it's sad that I know the exact titles of blog posts about monads...)<p>What I like about RWH is that it builds up monads as ""why you need this"".  You see code in its non-monadic form for a while, and then monads are introduced, and suddenly you see the same program being significantly smaller.  You understand the before and after, and can begin to reason for yourself what a monad is.  And it becomes abundantly clear why they are useful in Haskell -- you just saw your program shrink by 2/3s.<p>And a nitpick unrelated to your article -- I notice a lot of Haskell articles implement things unnaturally just to use a certain feature.  This makes it hard to understand why you would actually <i>want</i> to use that feature.  The reader skims the article, says ""this is just a fold"", and dismisses monads forever.

The original post, now many levels up, said ""kids bitch about how hard it is to manage memory"".  It is hard.  That's why people bitch about it, and don't want to do it.<p>I say that it's conceptually very simple.  But in practice, it's very difficult to type the code to do this yourself at the right place.  (It doesn't sound difficult, but most C programs either leak memory or use memory they didn't allocate, so clearly it is difficult.)  There is a reason why C++ has things like the boost pointer library (and even auto_ptr).  It's because memory management is for computers to do, not for humans to do.<p>I think people have trouble realizing that a <i>human</i> can know both ""high-level"" and ""low-level"" things, but that a <i>programmer</i> needs to stick to one level or the other -- don't write low-level concepts (memory allocators) in your high-level application program.  The same person can write both parts, but the programmer writing the high-level app shouldn't be worried about the low-level details (""of course it works"").  When you mix the levels of abstraction, you write bad code.<p>(I wrote a toy language once.  I found that writing a garbage collector was much easier to get right than manually managing my own memory.  When writing the collector, the details of memory allocation was all I needed to think about.  When writing the high-level application code on top, all I had to think about was my high-level application.

A good amount of CS majors go on to take Operating Systems, whose core project (writing a kernel from scratch) requires that you interface with the virtual memory capabilities of the x86 processor (involving frame allocations, setting up the page table, etc.)<p>Maybe the ageism thing is more of a lack of understanding on both sides than a directed bias against only the older people?<p>I'm not trying to say that young people won't end up being better programmers in 10 to 20 years; if that weren't the case, there'd be no point in pursuing it as a career.

The speed limit in the absence of a posted numerical limit was the ""reasonable and proper"" number.<p>It is certainly a complex area.  I know that one of the issues was that out-of-state people were going there and acting as if there were no limit.<p>I think there are other measures of usefulness of such limits as these--one is wear and tear on the roads.  The other is property damage.  There is a famous case of icing in Chicago a number of years ago where the express lanes in the outbound Kennedy saw a massive pile-up.  There were complaints about bad design of that part of the highway, even extending to some officials.  The engineers responsible for the design pointed out that the road was designed for the posted speed limit.  If you have ever driven on the Chicago expressways, the posted speed limit isn't even thought of as a challenge--it is totally ignored.<p>Thus, here is one incident of property damage as a result of speed limit violations.<p>So the issue is more involved than just the death toll.  Injuries were not noted in the statistics either.<p>Disclaimer: I grew up in Montana, and still have family there.",1266973388
