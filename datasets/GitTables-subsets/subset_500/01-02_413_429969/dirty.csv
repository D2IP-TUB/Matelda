Saying that &quot;the time was such that someone like so and so HAD to rise up&quot; is meaningless. Nothing HAS to happen, in the realms of human behavior.

10630887,comment,10630565,10630565,0,0,joeclark77,,,"I think the societies that are culturally willing to embrace self-driving cars are the ones that already have better solutions.  I&#x27;m talking about the downtowns of major cities, Silicon Valley, university districts, etc.  In most cases bicycles, light rail, or buses are already being used and are more efficient than a million people riding alone in self-driving cars.  If anything, these are the places that might ban private car ownership as population density increases.<p>On the other hand, no self-respecting country boy is going to want to give up the freedom and independence that he gets from driving his own vehicle.  Separating yourself from the herd is a value proposition, and self-driving cars can&#x27;t compete with it.<p>What&#x27;s left?<p>1. In some cases suburbanites might use self-driving cars to get from the suburbs to the edge of the car-free downtown zone.  It&#x27;s possible the technology would work for them, but, do any of them perceive an unmet need?  Is there anybody out there really frustrated by having to look at the road during their commute?  I would think there&#x27;s a lot more incentive to find ways to shorten the commute, than to simply make it hands free.<p>2. Interstate trucking is a possible use case, if people would tolerate it.  You&#x27;d need a plurality of states to get on board with the idea of a very potentially deadly machine going on autopilot, and you&#x27;d need to sort out who&#x27;s liable when people are killed by it.  And you need to figure out the &quot;last mile&quot; -- who drives the truck after it takes the exit off the highway.  There&#x27;s a real shortage of truck drivers in the world, so this is probably the one market where there&#x27;s a commercial incentive to develop the tech, though.",1448503011

What science has taught and made us so much more aware of, is how much uncertainty is a central, inescapable feature of the human condition, yet it is the fact of life we resist most strongly.<p>So it&#x27;s unsurprising scientists (and the progress of science) have often stumbled on the merely human side of things, we are social creatures, and such attributes are not removed just because we are &quot;doing science&quot;, much less when individuals become celebrities on account of it.<p>Seems to me the essence of the scientific approach is the willingness to say &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; when we don&#x27;t know, and to own up to mistakes or wrong conclusions when conclusions turn out to be incomplete or misguided.  Well maybe it would be better not to be so firm about conclusions anyway, as the article points out, history has shown that whatever we regard as &quot;facts&quot; at a particular time are at best temporary rest stops on the path of increasing knowledge.",1448502566

10630865,comment,10626123,10626123,0,0,noobermin,,,"<i>Where once logical criteria between science and non-science (or pseudo-science) were sought and taken seriously—Karl Popper’s criterion of “falsifiability” was perhaps the most famous, insisting that a sound theory could, in principle, be proved wrong by one test or another—many historians and philosophers of science have come to think that this is a naïve view of how the scientific enterprise actually works. They see a muddle of coercion, old magical ideas, occasional experiment, hushed-up failures—all coming together in a social practice that gets results but rarely follows a definable logic.</i><p>Ugh, that &quot;many historians or philosophers of science&quot; comes off as the &quot;informed sources&quot; that conspiracy theorists claim have evidence of chemtrails or the reptilian brotherhood. Who exactly are these people and what is precisely their argument? In my opinion, this is the single greatest thing that distinguishes science from other fields, it is inductive reasoning[0] taken to an extreme. Therefore, if anyone has reason to doubt Popper&#x27;s criterion, then that should be of heavy focus in the article. The author is almost guilty of &quot;argument by inaccessible literature&quot;[1] for what I would think is the most important part of his argument.<p>However, he does make an important point. Science is a human endeavour, and given that, it has issues that human institutions have. However, assuming uniformity of cognitive biases across both scientists and magicians[2], this just puts them on equal footing, while scientists have their experimental criterion, which then puts them ahead of magicians anyway.<p>With regards to the entanglement saga, I think the reason no one heard about it is much more mundane...there simply was no way to test it until Bell&#x27;s inequality, so scientists didn&#x27;t think about it. So yes, &quot;just ignore it&quot; was the solution because without a testable hypothesis, and may be some interesting math, scientists just don&#x27;t pursue it. In that way, science might suffer due it being performed by human scientists who do have moods, but once experiment entered the picture, boy did the field blow up! I don&#x27;t think it had much to do with changing attitudes as much as it came with the ability to test Bell&#x27;s inequality. The same could be said about GR, with the current advances in numeric GR in the last decade spurring interest in it. It is because our moods change, but I think it has a lot more to do with the feasibility of advancement in a field that it does with external influences like the internet or cultural changes.<p>There are many other interesting problems with established physics, like Godel&#x27;s metric[3], but, as you guessed it, you don&#x27;t hear about it because there is no experimental evidence of it, so physicists look elsewhere.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://staffhome.ecm.uwa.edu.au/~00043886/humour/invalid.proofs.html#1.13Proofbyreferencetoinaccessibleliterature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://staffhome.ecm.uwa.edu.au/~00043886/humour/invalid.pro...</a><p>[2] (which is a scientifically testable hypothesis! but I am unqualified to give evidence for it either way<p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel_metric"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel_metric</a>",1448502471

The article connects a lot of disparate facts about science as an industry (academia/grants, journals, etc) to how specific theories evolved to speculation about the nature of the scientific method without ever connecting how those are related or even placing them in the right chronological frame of reference. Renaissance &quot;science&quot; != 18th-19th century &quot;science&quot; != first half of 20th century &quot;science&quot; != post WWII modern &quot;science&quot; and I say &quot;science&quot; in scare quotes because the article entirely fails to separate the scientific mindset, which has arguably been in play from the beginning of human civilization as a logical extension of the natural selection of ideas, from the infrastructure meant to support science as a field, from funding to publication. The latter has changed drastically at least once a century since the Renaissance and you can&#x27;t understand the former without knowing what that change looked like.<p><i>》One way or another, science really happens. The claim that basic research is valuable because it leads to applied technology may be true but perhaps is not at the heart of the social use of the enterprise. The way scientists do think makes us aware of how we can think. Samuel Johnson said that a performer riding on three horses may not accomplish anything, but he increases our respect for the faculties of man. The scientists who show that nature rides three horses at once—or even two horses, on opposite sides of the universe—also widen our respect for what we are capable of imagining, and it is this action, at its own spooky distance, that really entangles our minds.</i><p>What in the world does this even mean? Science is revered as much as it is today simply because it has proven over and over again that it is the only field and/or industry and/or intellectual pursuit that is capable of producing truth that is independent of race, religion, or socioeconomic status. THAT is the true utility of science: demonstrating that there is a frame of reference that the vast majority of human beings can participate in and get the exact same results as anyone else. Riding three horses at once is pointless but providing a common language for the <i>epistemology of human civilization</i> isnt just for the warm fuzzies.<p>I think I have very much misunderstood the author and am butchering his argument for the sake of a straw man, but I can&#x27;t help but feel that every other paragraph has yet another assertion that is too vague to be wrong but too specific to be right, all without a central premise other than &quot;science works&quot; and &quot;fallible humans do science so science is fallible.&quot;",1448501222

The question of whether individuals are primary influence on events or whether things are &quot;in the air&quot; and thus almost bound to happen (albeit caused by some individual or other) has been kicked around for at least a couple centuries.  Napoleon was one of early examples often used.  Was he a unique individual who exerted enormous influence on course of world events?  Certainly.  Were conditions in the world ripe for an individual to exert forces like Napoleon did, and would someone like Napoleon have arisen if Napoleon had never been born?  Also, perhaps, yes.<p>Evidence for the &quot;in the air&quot; version clearly exists in science and mathematics, where progress leads a certain direction, then a particular individual is the one who makes big advance or discovery. Often more than one person is independently making the same advance at the same time. Think of Newton and Leibniz, who independently and at same time developed calculus.  Or Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, same thing with theory of evolution.  All of these guys did extremely impressive things.  But do you really think nobody else would have developed calculus or discovered evolution if these guys had all died in childbirth?<p>I&#x27;m not saying all advancements are 100% &quot;in the air&quot; and that individuals basically do nothing.
