9049075,comment,9047786,9048233,0,0,mdda,,,"(responding here because your comment addresses the actual new content of the paper).<p>Four things pop out at me from the paper:<p>1)  The whitening (per batch) & rescaling (overall) is a neat new idea.  But (as referred to in their p5 comment about the bias term being subsumed) this also points to the idea that the (Wu+b) transformation probably has a better-for-learning &#x27;factorization&#x27;, since their un-scale/re-scale operation on (Wu+b) is mainly taking out such a factor (while also putting in the minibatch accumulation change).<p>2)  The idea that this could replace Dropout as the go-to trick for speeding up learning is pretty worrying (IMHO), since the gains from Dropout seem to be in a &#x27;meta network&#x27; direction, rather than a data-dependency direction.  Both approaches seem well worth understanding more thoroughly, even though the &#x27;do what works&#x27; ML approach might favour leaving Dropout behind.<p>3)  The publication of this paper, so closely behind the new ReLu+ results from Microsoft, seems too coincidental.  One has to wonder what other results each of the companies has in their back-pockets so that they can repeatedly steal the crown from each other.<p>4)  For me, the application to MNIST is attention-grabbing enough.  While I appreciate that playing with Inception (etc) sexes-up the paper a lot, it raises the hurdle for others who may not have that quantity of hardware to contribute to the (more interesting) project of improving the learning rates of all projects (which is quite possible to do on the MNIST dataset, except that it&#x27;s pretty much &#x27;solved&#x27; with the error cases being pretty questionable for humans too).",1423900705

A modern server should either listen on :: with IPV6_V6ONLY=0, or set IPV6_V6ONLY=1 and create two sockets listening on :: and 0.0.0.0.<p>One annoying thing about the socket API is that binding to loopback always requires two sockets, one for 127.0.0.1 (or ::ffff:127.0.0.1) and another for ::1.<p>And if you ever create a listen API that accepts &quot;localhost:8080&quot; as input, but only creates one socket for one address, then a pox on your house.",1423900498

9049054,comment,9047833,9048949,0,0,archagon,,,"My skepticism has to do with the following:<p>* People talk about how automatic cars have been extensively tested. That&#x27;s not really true. There&#x27;s only a handful of them on the roads and they&#x27;ve been tested in limited conditions, with particular limits placed on suburban driving (slow speeds, etc.). I suspect there will be entirely new classes of bugs when there are hundreds of different AIs competing on the road, especially when mixed with normal human traffic.<p>* LIDAR does not work in poor weather conditions, including ice on the road.<p>* In terms of AI, getting to the 90% point is relatively easy, but it seems like the last 10% would require something resembling true intelligence. How do you deal with a lack of markers on the road? Dangerous situations in shady areas? Sensor equipment getting damaged and feeding your car wrong information? Animals and children running out last-second into the road? Severe obstacles at a distance? Tiny, cramped residential roads with non-sidewalk pedestrian traffic? Accommodating emergency vehicles and police? We shut off our brains when driving 90% of the time, but that last 10% does require human levels of intelligence. Furthermore, unless <i>every</i> car on the road is automated, the AI in automatic cars will need to deal with the idiosyncrasies of other human drivers. Sudden merges. Speeding. Road rage. Unexpected emergencies. Tailgating. An AI can&#x27;t send and receive feedback to other human drivers and pedestrians; it can only use its model of human behavior to predict likely outcomes. (And this is saying nothing of other AIs on the road, who might behave completely unlike human drivers.)<p>* People say that automated cars only need to drive better than human drivers, not perfectly. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true. If automated cars drove perfectly 99.9999% of the time but then crashed <i>horribly</i> that remaining 0.0001% — taking some poor pedestrians or bicyclists along with them — I wouldn&#x27;t get into one. And I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be street-legal. Most people don&#x27;t want to think about human lives in terms of numbers; they&#x27;d rather have control over their actions and accept the inevitability of occasional accidents, rather than having a machine that&#x27;s practically guaranteed to eat up human lives every so often.<p>* Speaking of which, how does the car decide who gets to live in a life-or-death situation? Are there situations where the car would elect to kill the <i>driver?</i> Which programmer gets to make that decision? I&#x27;d like to know this information before getting into my car, please. The idea of offloading split-second moral decisions to an AI seems like it should be <i>severely</i> legislated.<p>* People talk about mesh networking improving traffic and whatnot. I can&#x27;t even get my USB devices to work across OSes half the time, and we&#x27;re talking about sophisticated traffic control across multiple manufacturers? Especially given the quality of software that car companies tend to put out?<p>* Self-driving technology is extremely expensive, and most cars on the road are pretty cheap. You&#x27;d have to have some sort of insane subsidy program to get more than the 1% driving automated cars.<p>* People want to get in their self-driving cars drunk, but I think there will be severe legal hurdles in the way of that.<p>I think semi-automated and AI-augmented driving are certainly possible. Highways are easy enough to tackle. I could see some expensive cars getting that capability over the next few decades, as well as maybe cargo trucks. But endpoint to endpoint driving, where you could snooze on your way to work? I don&#x27;t think so.",1423899866

9049048,comment,9048110,9048945,0,0,Sanddancer,,,"I&#x27;d argue overly simple. The nest, and the other detectors, both have baffles in them to block out light from the outside world. However, the Nest negates some of the benefits from this by having the LED shine against a piece of plastic at an angle fairly close to the photodetector. If that piece of plastic happens to be especially reflective, or if the photodiode and/or LED happen to be misaligned, it would be more likely to trigger false alarms. The baffles in the other detectors, on the other hand, are also used to ensure that the light from the LED gets nowhere near the photodiode unless light&#x27;s being scattered by smoke. The Nest design works great in the lab, but when assembled en mass, hits a bunch of tolerance issues that leads to a more jittery product.",1423899717
