Sometimes I need to do that before I get down to the nitty-gritty of the real design, real implementation and real details, so I need some rule of thumb to let me give broad ROM estimates.<p>One of our major customers recently asked for a feature and my sales colleague asked how long it would take.  We didn't really know what the customer thought they wanted, so I went into a huddle with my lead programmer and together we sketched a reasonable feature that seemed to match the requirement, and estimated about 4 days of actual coding.  I went back and replied that it would be 5 weeks of work on this feature (4 x 6 days) and that, given other commitments, that would be about 3 months elapsed time (one programmer working 1/2 time).  So that's 5 weeks NRE on this feature, 3 months to delivery.<p>The feature was priced accordingly, and when the customer upped the priority we put a programmer on it full time.  It was delivered to site and signed off 6 weeeks later.<p>Sometimes you need to estimate.<p>So, what was your point?<p>ADDED IN EDIT: I am, by the way, quite serious about that question.  For me, in my circumstances, I really, <i>really</i>  need to estimate in broad outline and get it roughly right.  I'd like to see a clear exposition of why you think what I do is wrong.  Could you perhaps write a more considered piece on your blog and link to it?",1283237270

There's the general problem of when to call it quits and then there's your particular startup.<p>I would have to say that in my opinion working in the music industry is a tar pit. (I used to work at a major label) Because of the legal issues surrounding copyright law, the upsides are limited. In the case where you are successful, you will usually get shut down by either one of the labels, all of the labels and/or RIAA. Look at Muxtape if you want an example.<p>I usually use the analogy of a concert... you want to be close to the stage and you see an area really close that's free so you start making your way over there. Once you get there you see there's something wrong with it. Either it's behind a pillar or there's people sitting on the ground there, or someone's puked there.<p>This happens to music startups all the time.

When you have for example a new project, you split up all task to be done in several-hour long chunks and you assign those chunks to all team member in a way so that the work is comparable (roughly equal parts GUI, algorithm implementation etc.), it's reasonable to expect that everybody would product about the same amount of code (or checkins or similar).

It's unlike Hacker News in that way. Hacker News exists to talk about interesting articles; TechCrunch is a newspaper - it exists to write them. So for them, commenting <i>is</i> a commodity.<p>Secondly, I think your views on CMSs are a very bad strategy (a classic case of ""not invented here"" syndrome, which is bad). They're also wrong - I don't think CMSs looks are generic at all. At least not with a decent CMS, which you can theme. Wordpress, for example, can be made to look completely different from one site to the next.<p>Lastly, I think you're missing the obvious tradeoff involved.

I start this thing on said page and track what you do with the rest of the session on the off-chance that you do something sensitive with it. It's like a single-tab key/screenlogger.

It's going to be at least as effective as current phishing methods, with the added advantage of not asking for personal data on the landing page as well (so users don't get scared off).<p>A similar attack would be to override the back button. You know those sites where the back button takes you to a redirect that takes you to the same page? Take one of those, but on the redirect page save the referring URL.

1648611,comment,1648594,1648594,0,0,patio11,,,"There is a happy middle ground somewhere between ""SEO douchebag"" and ""engineer scornful of effective marketing.""<p>Why should Google pick your review for e.g. Scott Pilgrim over every other review on the Internet?  Is it better written?  Who will attest to that?  Is it from a better brand than Rotten Tomatoes or a more trusted voice than Roger Ebert?  Is it better designed?  Does it have a voice or perspective that speaks to an audience which Rotten Tomatoes and Ebert tragically ignore?  If it does, why aren't people mentioning so?<p>Go down the line for everything else you do: is this the best cat picture on the Internet?  What attests to that?  Is this the best Java framework tips on the Internet?  What attests to that?<p>More broadly, is there a market niche for someone who is a bit of a Java programmer, a bit of a film critic, and a bit of a cat photographer, and will it support you against the competition from people who make it their <i>mission in life</i> to do funny cat photos?<p>Also, is it a good idea to get into these particular niches?  LOLcats are are commodity business: any idiot can make them, many do.  Reviews are a commodity business unless you are Roger Ebert: I can't name another reviewer in the entire world, and if you randomly pulled sentences from your review and the 15 other reviews of Scott Pilgrim that I read because I have far too much free time, I think it is highly unlikely that I will be able to identify your review.  Or anyone else's, except Ebert.<p>Java programming tips are, potentially, not a commodity business.  You could either go StackOverflow (community, comprehensiveness, etc are value adds) or you could go Subject Domain Expert For Japanese Entrance Examination File Formats in Java.  But, at the other end of the scale, ""opinions about the new Java release from someone who is not Knuth, Gosling, or Alan Turing back from the dead"" is a commodity business.<p>Commodity businesses are bad places to be if you want quality to win out, because minute differentiations in quality are essentially unimportant in commodity businesses.  There are many, many IP-based businesses where minute differentiations in quality mean 100x differences in returns.  If you like quality, you probably want to be in one of those instead.<p>""If I wrote it, they will come"" is not a marketing strategy.",1283235354
