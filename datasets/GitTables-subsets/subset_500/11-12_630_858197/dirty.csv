Just doing it for <i>names</i> is worth hundreds of millions of dollars -- think of how many there are, how often they are searched, and how little competition there is for most of them.

You get to invest a large amount of money into a pretty good return investment, with hardly any outlay from yourself.<p>If you were renting and putting the (maybe Â£100 a month max) difference into some investment, you'd make next to nothing on that. But with a mortgage, you're 'investing' the banks money as well as your own.<p>I've only bought 2 houses in my life (3rd one soon), but both were financially very good.

1042946,comment,1042934,1042934,0,0,patio11,,,"I'm torn.  On the one hand, it clearly succeeded as a publicity stunt.<p>On the other hand, in terms of discovering what users will pay for Creately, the experiment was a failure.  By essentially structuring the system as ""donate us money"", you prime the users to think ""Hmm, even $1 is being generous to them.  I'm a big spender... I'll go as high as $3.""  That is, ahem, an <i>insane</i> price point for <i>any service</i>.<p>You have to convince someone to dig out their credit card to pay you money.  There is essentially no differentiation between $3 and $9 at that point, since neither amount is an appreciable amount of money to working professionals.  (Students are another case.  Since they're going to complain long and loudly about being made to pay, and are going to do their level best to steal your service anyhow, I think you can quite rationally make the decision just not seek their custom.  Alternatively, you can segment your plans such that one which is free but helps your marketing meets their needs.)  There are <i>tremendous</i> advantages to the business, however, from moving from $3 to $9.  (Revenues net of Paypal fees just increased by a factor of four.)<p>Note that $9 is still VERY VERY cheap.  The fully loaded cost of a professional exceeds that for every ten minutes.  Also, if you look at any SAAS business they'll tend to tell you the same thing: the most expensive plan, which is typically bought by employed professionals spending other people's money, brings in more revenue than any other plan.  This has been mentioned by Wufoo in interviews, it was true of DropSend when they published their numbers, and I know it to be true of three other companies who have not given me explicit permission to make the fact known.<p>Additionally, as Creately noticed, the kind of people who are attracted by ""This only costs a buck!"" are the worst customers in the known universe.  They cause hugely disproportionate loads on your support resources, and feel entitled to do so because they're Paying Good Money For This, Damn It.  They tend to churn like crazy.  They'll fail at the most trivial of tasks (like typing in their credit card details) and then blame <i>you</i> for it.  (When you spend a buck on something, if something goes wrong it is the merchants fault, the lazy bum.  When you spend hundreds on something, you darn well check to make sure it went through alright.)",1263122639

1042942,comment,1042896,1042938,0,0,axod,,,"I sort of disagree. I think BASIC is a good first language precisely because of its flaws.<p>Those flaws give you something to strive to improve, and gives you reason to seek out other tools. The flaws only start getting obvious when you start doing more advanced stuff, which is exactly how you want a beginners language to be.<p>For example I started with basic, and found it ridiculously slow for graphics, so learnt assembly and how to make qb libraries with tasm. Then I just started writing programs in asm without the need for basic. I also noted than in QB programs you could make the code run slower by adding empty lines to the source code, thought 'woah thats lame' and decided I'd probably not use basic much more.<p>There's always jarrings when you start to learn other languages - ""wtf are all those semicolons at the end of every line? etc"", but that's also a good skill to learn - being able to cope with new things that look odd at first sight.<p>The other point is that there are massive amounts of existing basic code around, and resources. That counts for a lot.<p>Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't use basic for anything now, but for teaching kids I think it's more than good enough.",1263121611
