427573,comment,427292,427292,0,0,vitaminj,,,"Wow, this article has some very tenuous links between Atlas Shrugged and real life. I'm going to just pick on one:<p>The appropriation of Rearden metal by the government in Atlas Shrugged was compared to Hank Paulson's insistence that the banks (which the government would bail out) had to hand over a percentage of their future profits back to the government. Apparently, these situations are eerily similar because in both cases the government did it for the ""public interest"".<p>Notwithstanding the fact that in Atlas Shrugged, Rearden actually invented something of value (which the govt appropriated), whereas in real life, the bankers fucked up their own balance sheets and were coming to the government cap in hand for help. As far as I'm aware, one is theft, the other is repaying a favour.<p>The only thing eerily similar about these two situations is that they both have a guy named Hank involved.",1231559539

427561,comment,424506,427454,0,0,op12,,,"Effectively infinite risk? So you think a regulatory agency in the US will allow prices of a stock, say, GE to reach an unbounded number and still require settlement in derivative contracts to this? And I would not be as quick as you are in calling a professional stupid for doing something that any professor of finance would tell you is important for smooth functioning of capital markets.<p>You seem to just not grasp the magnitude of what you assume people should do in this crazy option proposal. It is not unusual for a stock to have a 25% short interest. That means a quarter of the shares are sold short. So you are saying a quarter of shareholders should sell calls to every short seller who wants to hedge? What if most shareholders do not want to sell options, and not give up the upside in doing so (indeed, there is a tradeoff in ""juicing"" your return, you lose the upside). In fact, most do not, so this is entirely impractical of course.<p>The whole point is with proper regulation that prevents the case of a squeeze or errant prices that are not sound, you prevent the ""unlimited"" downside (if a company ever becomes infinitely valuable, we will have other more interesting issues to deal with). This happens all the time--exchanges can cancel trades done at what are called ""obvious error"" prices. Regulation effectively clips the tail, which is why dealers have no problem shorting shares to ensure liquid markets.",1231558718

That's enough (for me) to blow away the ""requires authorial control"" theory: no two performances are the same.<p>Or any book: everybody reads it and has a different mental image of what's going on.  (How many people read Dune and saw it as Lynch did?)  In a book, you're given fixed words and given free reign on the visual and auditory axes.  In a game, you're given fixed audiovisuals and given free reign on plot.  I don't see how one could be inherently artistic, and the other not.

427530,comment,427319,427465,0,0,ja2ke,,,"There's a strong misunderstanding going on here of what ""authorial control"" means, though. Anything you can do in a game, even a free-form game, is taking place within a system of rules set down by the game's designers and programmers. Games are interactive, and obviously accept input from the player, but they are as strongly, and really, as exclusively authored as any other medium.<p>Ebert comes at it entirely from a film point of view -- video game players can (depending on the game) have control of the camera, of the movements and decisions and dialog choices of the protagonist, or even in some cases, control of the narrative! Every movement in a game, though, is restricted (or it might be better to say, ""allowed for"" or ""enabled""), by the designers. Unless it is a poorly constructed game, you can't go walking off out of the game's predetermined accessible areas. Every line of dialog was written by a writer, or recorded by a voice actor (or, if it uses some sort of procedurally generated speech system, is operating under rules built by a programmer and game designer). Some games are more forgiving of ""emergent"" moments than others -- having gameplay systems which are built to intersect and collide in unexpected ways -- but all of those underlying systems were designed and built with the purpose and expectation of creating interesting collisions.<p>The problem is that Ebert is framing games like he'd frame a piece of serious film or literature -- defining authorial control in terms of narrative, or at least in terms of character, which is ridiculous. If Ebert ventured into a gallery space and encountered an interactive art installation which created some sort of projection which responded to his body movement, voice, and an artist-chosen soundtrack, would he declare that it inherently wasn't ""art"" because it wasn't a painting?<p>I think he's confusing the presence of a protagonist and the use of filmic storytelling tools and cinematography for a classic narrative work, and then sees players diverting that narrative and shaping that narrative and tearing it apart, and decides that there can't be anything valid there.<p>Narrative can be a great tool, or even a framework, to build into a game, but the rules of conventional narrative not what games are inherently about, and that makes them a misguided criteria by which to judge them.",1231556539
