Which is this: whatever the merits of the original discussion or dissent, this level of attack is not helpful; I don&#x27;t want it done on my <i>behalf.</i> What it has served to make me feel is precisely what I think you are trying to avoid: like I can&#x27;t hold the opinions I do, because women are only allowed to think that HN is a unilaterally awful place. I feel like I have to defend how I could possibly have the chromosomes I do and yet have mixed feelings about this website - or anything else. Trying to help women doesn&#x27;t make a person automatically right any more than me <i>being</i> a woman makes me automatically right about all questions pertaining to women.

In other words, none of us (you included) has the right to feel righteous: we all have something to learn.",1412243684

It sounds like a way to game the system. After all, growth is right there in the job title, and we all know hackers game systems.<p>The appeal of a &#x27;hacker&#x27; for growth is that it sounds like it solves the hard work of growing by building something people like.  We&#x27;ll just game around it with our hacker!<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the conscious intent, but I do think it&#x27;s the subconscious intent.

8400039,comment,8399767,8399767,13,0,tinco,,,"The hardest part is that most game engines are not designed to be networked in this way. Find an open source physics engine that natively supports teleportation, easing and prediction, they&#x27;re not there. UE4 is the first engine I&#x27;ve used that seems to have a very nice multiplayer API, and it&#x27;s only been out for indie developers for a couple of months.<p>So the hard part is not devising the networked scheme, it&#x27;s building a whole game engine (or thoroughly modding one) afterwards, at least in my experience.<p>I was working on a multiplayer racing game project (like GTA2), and my approach was to run 2 physics engines in parallel. One physics engine would always be authoritive, and be in sync with the server, but because of the lag would always be a frame or two (or more) behind. The other would be working on predicting what is going to happen. Every frame snapping back to the authority, and then applying the (predicted and user) inputs over that.<p>The actual position the user would see would be an averaged position between the current predicted position, and its previous predicted position (to prevent too much jitter/snapback).<p>If you&#x27;ve got a better scheme to do networked physics I&#x27;m all ears :)",1412243340
