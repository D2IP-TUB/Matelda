I played Parallel Universe 2 for awhile, and when I got bored I set up a bookmarklet that would adventure out into a particular level, fight enemies, collect treasure, and even resurrect itself when it died. The game's item-selling interface kind of sucked, it just said the item name and you could click for details, but that's rather inefficient since I had 1k-2k items after a day of auto-playing. I made a bookmarklet that opened each item window, grabbed the items's stats, wrote them to the item list, and closed the window. It took ~15 minutes to run for that many items, but hey, I had to find the best ones somehow right? :)<p>I played The Hacker Project for awhile too. They had voting links - they were on about 20 top-game lists, and they gave everybody a small reward for voting once a day. The voting link went to a vote.php?link=n page, for n=1-20. Did they allow numbers over 20? Nope. How about under 1? Yep! I went to vote.php?link=0, vote.php?link=-1, and checked a few to make sure they worked.

However, OS X sucked off most of that momentum, and now I would guess the primary users of Linux are developers who deploy onto Linux servers or embedded devices who realize that it's easier to develop on the same platform you deploy on.   (And who have a lot of knowledge about the platform because they deploy on it).<p>But there is a growing ""Apple is evil"" movement, and I expect Linux to get some momentum from that.  I wish that more people would try Linux for it's positive features -- for example, Virtual Desktops is my killer feature, but Linux still gets most of its users because its ""not Windows"" and ""not Apple"".<p>One huge advantage that Linux does have is that it's really the only Desktop platform that's seeing rapid advancement.   KDE 4 is maturing into a very nice platform, Gnome 3 is coming out soon, all with significant changes and enhancements, for good or bad.   OTOH, OS X 10.7 is coming out with what, an app store?<p>Of course, neither Microsoft nor Apple are putting a lot of effort into desktop environments because of their decreasing relevance...",1287930442

So consider what else comes along with the money and don't always just take the highest offer -- look at the value of each.  The same applies for a sale transaction.<p>Opinion: While this is somewhat self serving for him to get people thinking this way it is true.  Consider this example:  Investor A offers you 5M at 20M for 25% of the company but doesn't know or understand your market and investor B offers you 4M at 16M for 25% of the company but has built a successful business in your market before and can help you avoid costly mistakes.<p>The same applies on a sale transaction.  If you think the acquirer doesn't understand your business then the maximum value you'll see from that transaction is on the day of it.  If you believe they understand it and it'll continue to grow you can stay on board and create much more value of which you'll be rewarded for.",1287929564

We've over run our phosphorous reserves. We're depleting energy, land and the ability to feed our civilization.

Yes, none of this will kill the planet or this species for that matter, but it will kill this civilization.<p>In fact, this has happened again and again throughout history as Jared Diamond points out in his book, Collapse. When you see the record of civilizations and the choices they have made then 5 key metrics stand out;<p>1)  Environmental damage<p>2)  Climate change<p>3)  Hostile neighbors<p>4)  Friendly trade partners<p>5)  The societies response to it's environmental problems<p>What's interesting is how he compared these metrics and individually isolated cases in histories where only a few were present and used them as examples to see what was going on. It's a beautiful and thrilling exploration between the factors, stakeholders at play and why those choices were made (as far as we know). A comment simply won't do that entire thing justice.<p>The thing is that there is a delicate interplay between our surroundings and our civilization and stretching it too far without healing won't lead to pleasant consequences. A civilization is a delicate state of things that needs to be maintained at a certain cost be it resources, intellectual or cultural capital. Everything joins to create an integrated whole and that's the problem; you can't have one without the other.<p>So, essentially we need to make a series of choices about how we are doing things and how we could do them if we want this period of prosperity to survive beyond a few decades.<p>Yes there is hope, but there's loads of work to do.<p>see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_to_Fail_or_Succeed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_...</a>",1287928846
