7862470,comment,7862317,7862317,4,0,nomailing,,,"Maybe it would be possible if you can circumvent the human sensory organs and directly feed the signal to higher brain areas. The delays in sensory modalities are anyway very diverse and not at all synchronously processed in real-time. Even within the same modality the signal is disintegrated in the brain. For example an image from the retina is processed with completely different delays in the ventral and dorsal stream. The ventral stream has latencies of several 100 ms [1]. It is still an open question in neuroscience how these different latencies are combined in higher areas in a way that they are perceived as synchronous.<p>So even if you are in a conversation with people directly in front of you, you do not actually have a real-time system. It takes roughly 400 ms until the image of a face of a person standing in front of you is processed in the ventral stream and is actually detected. On the other hand there is the auditory modality which is much more sensitive to latencies. But in the end the brain gives you the illusion that anything you perceive is actually real-time, although it is not. So if your brain decides to give a motor signal to actually press a piano key, then only many 100 ms later the actual sound will arrive. The perceptible latency of hearing a sound is actually only because the brain itself takes into account the delays in itself.<p>So in the end it comes down to trick the brain into believing something is real-time. This is for example done in multiplayer ego-shooters where the motions of other players are actually interpolated into the future and later on corrected if the other player actually changed their last motion command.<p>[1] Barragan-Jason G, Besson G, Ceccaldi M and Barbeau EJ (2013) Fast and famous: looking for the fastest speed at which a face can be recognized.

He says the CB income data understates income on the high end because it exclude the value of capital gains, but it ALSO understates income on the low end because it excludes the value of non-cash benefits. These effects work in opposite directions; it does thus seem plausible that the resulting Gini is in approximately the right ballpark. Furthermore, note that we don&#x27;t actually care about the Gini AMOUNT here, we just care about the TREND. So unless the ratio of normal income to capital gains is changing quite a lot (and in the appropriate direction) it&#x27;s not going to produce the result you want.<p>> Frankly I could simply interpret his chart as showing that rich are increasingly moving their gains away from income and towards capital gains to avoid taxes.<p>You are expressing a hunch.

What you&#x27;re not seeing is how the founder&#x27;s equity gets eroded as he is forced to borrow money in order to build out the team to rearchitect the app in order to deal with the scale.

They might know about a fight or conflict with someone that you had in the past that you&#x27;ve forgotten.  Thanks to Maps, they might know about excursions that you&#x27;ve taken that you no longer remember.<p>They may be able to determine things about the state or evolution of your relationships with other people when you&#x27;re not consciously aware of those things yourself, in terms of patterns in how and when and how often you contact each other, and perhaps with what degree of affection or intimacy.  (Obviously people often know a lot about the state of their own relationships, but they might not consciously notice certain kinds of gradual changes.)<p>If there are inferences that can be made from your searches, they might be able to make those inferences when you haven&#x27;t made them yourself.<p>One example would be a disease that someone is trying unsuccessfully to self-diagnose (so they search for the symptoms), or a set of symptoms over a long period of time whose combined significance the sufferer never recognizes.<p>Another example would be a person who has same-sex sexual attractions that they haven&#x27;t consciously admitted to themselves, but that are evidenced in some of their searches or search patterns or clicks on search results.  (Or just other online activity; there was research about figuring out if people are gay from their Facebook likes, and there must be lots and lots of correlates.)<p>Clearly Google hasn&#x27;t productized most of these inferences in the sense of making them available to advertisers to use for targeting.  There are many possible reasons for that.  Some inferences would require a manual analysis of data; some are too speculative and have too high a probability of error; some are too creepy or alarming to the user.<p>This actually makes me want to start a separate thread: What does Google know about you that you don&#x27;t?

Depending on what you&#x27;re doing that distinction can be important.

For example, once the element type size exceeds 64 bits, you can no longer assume an atomic write/read. This isn&#x27;t a big problem considering that concurrent data structures don&#x27;t usually rely on the write/read atomicity of the elements themselves (though they do rely on atomicity of modifying internal, structural data), but that&#x27;s just something to think about.",1402156912

He&#x27;s very much a pen-paper-human kind of guy, and I don&#x27;t see him all of a sudden deciding to step into the internet.<p>I&#x27;ll be darned if he couldn&#x27;t find someone to work with who could handle getting his work online though. It&#x27;s mere wishful thinking, but he could draw and communicate (or not) in whichever way he wants, and some trusted friend and gatekeeper handles all of the scanning and online stuff, which could be kept very simple and noncommercial. No ads, twitter, comments section or any of the usual &quot;social media branding&quot; stuff, literally just a page with a comic on it.<p>Sigh. Man, I still miss Calvin and Hobbes.",1402156839
