For example, on the ""n-body"" problem, both Ruby and SBCL grow 31% on x86-64.  But Ruby on ""pidigits"" grows only 2%, while SBCL on that problem adds a whopping 111%.  On ""spectral-norm"", Ruby grows 61%, while SBCL grows 31%.<p>So this appears to be a place where moving to 64-bit is completely unknown, and you have to test for your specific application.

The last few decades have seen steady and dramatic increases in the incidence of boys and young men suffering from genital deformities, low sperm count, sperm abnormalities and testicular cancer. At the same time, boys are now far more at risk of suffering from ADHD, autism, Tourette's syndrome, cerebral palsy, and dyslexia. The Disappearing Male takes a close and disturbing look at what many doctors and researchers now suspect are responsible for many of these problems: a class of common chemicals that are ubiquitous in our world. Found in everything from shampoo, sunglasses, meat and dairy products, carpet, cosmetics and baby bottles, they are called ""hormone mimicking"" or ""endocrine disrupting"" chemicals and they may be starting to damage the most basic building blocks of human development",1227556240

It's what the top-down folks are saying, but plainly, and perhaps naively, I just think of what credit is used for - to buy what you can't with cash. Giving everyone cash would filter <i>up</i> to businesses; mortgage payments to brokerages, savings to banks, investments into the stock market and bonds, and purchases to retailers including automakers. Americans would have to do something with that money and there wouldn't be the huge management/distribution fees that are now going to get collected. In effect, you'd be giving the American people a vote about where the money should go based on their everyday needs. And that huge of a sum wouldn't be as easy to fritter away as a $300 ""stimulus"" plan. Heck, at $7.4 trillion you could give every man, woman, and child over $20,000 (for argument's sake, ignoring infrastructure which would be a mistake).",1227555706
375266,comment,375089,375173,0,0,jambarama,,,"There is concern about inflation from the level of Fed lending & rate of M1 creation.  However the bigger inflationary threat is when banks start lending again and this huge amount of money starts moving.  There is also a threat of deflation though,  offsetting this inflationary pressure, at least to some degree.  For example, falling house & stock prices do wipe out a lot of wealth (real or otherwise, and perhaps good or bad) - which adds  deflationary pressure.<p>So it is a balance between inflation & deflation.  Clearly the fed sees deflation as a bigger issue right now - the fed can fight inflation, negative interest rates that plagued japan for a decade are much harder for a central bank to fix.  They've cut short term lending rates as much as they can, effectively wiping out interest rates.  Personally, I don't know if they're lending too much or too little, and I'm sure Congress doesn't either, so I'm not convinced regulation (and the attendant political pressure) would be a net gain.",1227555685

Some of the biggest troublemakers are plant estrogen that is sprayed on crops to increase plant yields. This has been known, studied and re-studied since the 1960s. Here's the science:<p>About halfway through gestation, a male fetus emits a small amount of testosterone that travels from its testes to its brain. This tells it that it is a ""male"" brain. If it does not get that bit of hormone, the brain remains ""female"", by default. Importantly, while in animals this may determine mating behavior, it DOES NOT DO SO IN HUMANS. So please set aside any ideas about homosexuality, which is much more complicated than this.<p>If during early pregnancy, the mother either uptakes a chemical that blocks this transfer, interferes with this transfer, significantly increases the amount of estrogen in her body (usually from eating Tofu), or increases the tiny amount of natural testosterone in her body (from other chemicals), it interferes with the process.<p>While again, this will not determine sexual attraction, it will play some considerable part in the secondary sexual characteristics of the offspring. Either androgyny, more feminine males, or more masculine females.<p>When this was first discovered in the 1960s, they evaluated the gamut of variations, even putting testosterone in just half the brain, but not the other half, which resulted in both male and female mating behavior, the animal, but not human, version of bisexuality.<p>To conclude, once again, humans are a lot more complicated.

In times of tribal crisis, yes, men must die first.  As The Senior said so eloquently, <i>All societies are based on rules to protect pregnant women and young children</i> and anything else is <i>automatically genocidal.</i>  A lot of our biology has been geared towards this because it had to in order for our species to survive.<p>I'm not saying that sexism is automatically and always bad.  I am saying that, in times of relative peace and plenty, when survival is not an issue, the justification for sexism <i>in the eyes of the law</i> is just not there.<p>We don't lose enough soldiers in war that we really need to worry overmuch about replenishing the population.  Even the losses in the Civil War or WWII were a pretty insignificant piece of the population compared with the genocidal battles that were common in antiquity, and still go on today.  The government in America has no reason to be sexist.<p><i>your concept ignores the both the purpose and the practical workings of marriage all through human history</i><p>Sorry, gotta call bullshit on that one.  Exclusively heterosexual monogamy is a relatively new concept, as far as human history goes.  You don't have to look very far to find polyamory (along with polygyny and polyandry), bisexuality/homosexuality, and non-binary gender roles accepted as norms.  Look at feudal Japan, or classical Greece and Rome, or ancient Egypt, or the various native American cultures.  Throughout most of human history, the rich have traditionally kept multiple lovers, often of varying genders; by historical standards, we're all pretty damn rich today.<p>Each of those cultures had their own hang-ups, to be sure.  My point is, there's a wide enough spectrum that we should be skeptical of any statement that tries to abstract directly from the mores of the West of the last few centuries to a general statement about ""all of human history"".<p><i>I can imagine elephants inventing marriage, but I can't imagine them accepting gay marriage on the same terms as straight.</i><p>I suspect a failure of your imagination, rather than a failure of elephants.  Giraffes, dogs, chimps, lions, flamingos, sheep, and rams have all been observed engaging in homosexual behavior.  Same-sex penguin couples have been observed <i>pairing for life</i>.  I don't know if this has ever been seen in elephants, but as they are a very social and playful species, I'd be surprised if they were any different from other pack mammals and birds in this regard.<p>Of course, there are a lot of ""natural"" things that we nonetheless don't allow.  Rape and murder, for instance, are pretty common among primates, and humans have been doing this forever.  And lots of cultures have had their own weird sexual mores that we've thankfully abandoned.  As humans, we get to sort out what makes sense for us, on the basis of individual freedom.<p>My point is that, if you're going to take the position that committed homosexual pairing is somehow ""unnatural"", or if you think there's no evolutionary benefit to homosexuality, then You're Doing It Wrong.  Evolution is pretty smart.  It knows what it's doing.<p>If you're a kid and you have a gay uncle, and that uncle is in a committed relationship, then that's one set of cousins you don't have to compete with for food and attention.  You've basically got an extra set of parents to provide for you.<p><i>For example, I have explained how tax breaks for married couples benefit society: they give the provider an extra incentive to get and stay married, thus encouraging good offspring.</i><p>Gay couples encourage good offspring as well. Just not their <i>own</i> biological offspring.  They're quite likely to adopt, and are additional caretakers for their family's kids.  By being married, they're better at this.<p>Homosexual marriage also benefits society for several of the same reasons that heterosexual marriage does.  Married couples are generally more careful with their spending, take better care of their homes, and tend to have a greater investment in their neighborhoods and communities.  We ought to encourage that with our communal acceptance and respect, since it benefits us all.<p><i>Let's focus on the tax breaks.</i><p>Barking up the wrong tree, buddy.  I'm against the taxes that marriage provides breaks from.  If the government can't get enough by asking for the money, it doesn't have the right to take it by force.  The IRS makes less from income tax than we spend on our military empire—one injustice to pay for another.<p>Just as I would encourage a slave who breaks the law to escape his slavery, I support anyone getting out of whatever taxes they can dodge by any loopholes they can find.  More power to ’em.",1227554979

This is one small part of why I read HN, and other assorted ""news"" sites.  I like to stay current with the tools I use.  I don't jump at every new tool just because it's new, but I understand that my current set of tools is not perfect.  Sooner or later, I'm going to replace every tool in my toolbox with an even better tool.  I may like my current set of tools <i>today</i>, but I understand that it's important not to get so attached to them that I stagnate as a developer.  I think it's critically important for good developers to stay ""intellectually curious"".<p>1. I decided that git was worth trying.  So, I started using it with my next new project.  This allowed me to establish a new work flow without interrupting active projects.  Yes, you'll need to read man pages, cheat sheets, etc.  There's no point to adopting a new tool if it behaves exactly like the old one.  So, it shouldn't be a surprise when you actually have to commit to <i>learning</i> the new tool.  That said, I found git to be more user friendly than I'd expected based on the negative comments I'd read online.<p>2. I decided I liked the new work flow and that git was worth switching to.

His first big project at the age of 15 was a pirate radio station he built from scratch in his bedroom. He has been innovating ever since and has developed multiple novel electronics and radiometric products over the course of his career.<p>The other two co-founders have equally impressive backgrounds. One co-founder has over a decade of senior operations and intellectual property expertise. The second co-founder has over ten years experience in sales, marketing, and product development with both Fortune 1000 and several startup ventures. We do not have extensive lighting industry experience but instead have taken a hacker's approach to both the engineering and market challenges.<p>I am looking forward to sharing more about our 'secret sauce' but am limited until our provisionals are filed.<p>We are currently filing our first patents covering improvements in brightness, color rendering, control, thermal management, and cost - significant problems that have so far prevented widespread deployment of LEDs for  mainstream lighting.<p>Although our technology can be broadly applied we are focusing on launching a standalone consumer floor or desk lamp and have partnered with leading design partners to develop a simple, affordable, and attractive enclosure. We are not developing an LED light bulb but instead are focusing our resources on launching a lamp with breakthrough price performance to be sold over the internet to eco-friendly, design-savvy, gadget-geeks.<p>It will be as bright as a 100 watt incandescent light bulb but will consume a fraction of the energy, last up to 50x as long and will allow users to control the color temperature of light in addition to brightness.
