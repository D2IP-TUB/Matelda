And I remember the shit storm it caused quite fondly :-)<p>A couple of obvious points have been made at the time. Yes, it's a gross generalization. Yes, somewhere in there is an uncomfortable truth that is liable to make a couple of Java and COM artists very angry.<p>At the end the whole point boils down to the overused saying: real programmers ship. It's as simple as that. All this artificial distinction between ""Duct Tape Programmers"" and whatnot is just an attempt to elaborate somewhat unsuccessfully on a central experience of software development.<p>This is why:\nOur code sucks, and there are many reasons for it. We may have some control over WHY our code will suck, but the core fact is just inescapable. Of course, there are people who claim their code is always beautiful (often paired with energetic statements about some framework technology) and it's worth noting that those developers are easily the worst of them all. At least the rest of us have some semblance of self-awareness.",1286629085

My lady wanted an easy way to note specific vendors with items she liked and wanted to revisit, but the iPhone Maps app only let me drop one pin at a time, for some unknown reason. This lead me to imagining a map of the area with dozens of pins dropped by all sorts of people, with tips (""this lady is willing to haggle"", ""don't get your hopes up, this guy wants twice what his stuff is worth"") and recommendations (""avoid the seafood place. trust me.""). It's a little Foursquare-y, but less about, ""I'm here"" and more about, ""let me tell you what I've discovered.""<p>I imagine something like this could be used for all sorts of things, from large concerts like Coachella or Lollapalooza to keeping track of where one parked in a parking garage. The idea scales from personal location tracking to a sort of event-focused hive mind of wisdom.<p>Of course, it is entirely possible this already exists, and I just didn't check the App Store throughly enough.

However, I think it is a little early to shoot this research down, that should only come after a competing lab has tried to verify their findings and they turn out to be un-reproducible.<p>Not disclosing funding would be a problem if Bayer funds were used for this particular research, but if it wasn't then I don't have a problem with that, and even if the truth will come out eventually.",1286627309
