432020,comment,431703,431735,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"That is a good recipe. Gee, wish I had that 10 years ago, ha!<p>I would suggest PHP for ""scripting language"" since syntax-wise it is similar to C, so if one is learning that, then PHP goes with it nicely. w3c.org has good tutorials on all kinds of web related stuff, HTML, XSL, etc., including a tutorial on PHP. Recommend K&R's ""The C Programming Language"". That is like my holy book of programming, or would be, were I religious, lol. Plenty of books on shell scripting at the local barnes and noble, but I would focus on general syntax, not specific operating systems, since those come and go.",1231855000
432019,comment,431703,431839,0,0,ObieJazz,,,"I don't understand the mystique surrounding C. If you forget about pointers and structs for a minute and keep everything to one .c file and one .h file, there's nothing that would keep a beginner from learning the rest. Even though you can do complicated things with it, it's not that complicated of a language. Once a beginner learns to deal with ""array index out of bounds"" etc. they'll have a much easier time writing well-formed code in the future. C's role as an ancestor of (almost) all modern languages means that once you're familiar with it, new languages will be easier to pick up. Plus, the language has a great book: I'd tell a beginner to pick up Kernighan and Ritchie and read that.",1231854857

Worse still, he's wrong even on that small point.<p>I'm working on Delay Tolerant Networking for mobile phones, mostly for deployment in isolated communities in the developed world. Mobile phones are everything OLPC strives to be, cheap, portable, power optimised, connected and hackable. Better still, they do all this now. They're already available in any country in the world, manufactured in extreme volume, we don't have to wait for some philanthropist's wet dream to bear fruit.<p>Any of the software I write could be trivially repurposed to suit the needs of the third world. Then people could get the benefit of access to modern information networks without necessarily having to have all the modern infrastructure in place first.",1231854591

I have a burning, probably un-justified hatred of Eclipse, so I tried the AppFuse + NetBeans tutorial.<p>That may be the most unproductive I have felt in my entire life.  I made a damn login form and it took like 12 pages of tutorial, tons of setup, generating a whole bunch of files that seemed like they could have been done algorithmically because they are always the same, editing like nine different XML files with little bits of glue, and eventually like one or maybe two lines of code.<p>Then, I got to wait for the WAR to compile each time I wanted to test a change, because the tutorial didn't seem to know about a developer mode which probably exists.<p>I hate to sound all ranty and partisan, but I could find no way in which that process could be efficient and couldn't imagine anyone doing it voluntarily unless they were ordered or just had no exposure to the rest of the world.<p>Also, I sort of object to having code stuffed in an eight-folder deep hierarchy where the preceding seven folders contain nothing at all.

But I fail to see how sites like outside.in are helping.<p>My concern with what you guys do is that you've spent the last few years ""indexing"" everyone else's content...without hardly sending anyone to the original sites themselves.<p>I explained this to one of your biz-dev guys a few months back, so I see no need to do so here but I'll restate a few points.<p>I added my publication's RSS feed to outside.in several months ago.  Since then, my biggest day of referrals from you guys has been 6 visitors/24 hours according to Google analytics.  Big whoop.<p>Meanwhile, how many Google hits did you get from my content?  From everyone else's content?  Feel free to call me wrong with data, but I imagine Outside.in is an SEO machine and that Google accounts for most of your traffic.<p>How is this helping the publishers you ""index""? It's been very, very clear from day one how it's helping outside.in.<p>Your business-development guy told me you're hatching partnerships with major newspapers to put ""publisher"" content on their sites.  Will those links lead back to the original publishers?  Or will they point back to the summary page on Outside.in?<p>There are now a handful of players doing this between you, Everyblock, YourStreet...even the Huffington Post with its local channels.<p>And not one of them sends any actual traffic back to the sites they index. Meanwhile their traffic numbers go up, up, up, the VC money rolls in, and the publishers themselves keep on spiraling down.<p>People rip on Digg all the time.  But I tell you what, Digg actually sends bodies through the door.  Same with reddit and other sites like this.  Sure, they probably get a lot of Google hits that would otherwise go to the original sites, but they focus on sending people along to the original stories.  They profit from the ecosystem of good content and then contribute back to help new sites sprout up.",1231852727

Consolidation matters because what is constraining datacentres right now is power, cooling and floor loading.

431982,comment,431786,431786,0,0,mdasen,,,"Frameworks can sometimes be annoying.  It's like learning a new sub-language on top of the programming language as there is a certain amount of familiarity you need with a framework's calls (ex. to program in Python, it goes a lot faster if you know that it's len(list) not list.length() and similarly if you're using Rails it's important to know that there is no validates_is_number, but there is validates_numericality_of).  So, you start learning all these things that may or may not apply to your project - the language of the framework.  And in some places it slows you down and you feel like there's abstraction just for the sake of abstraction, but in the end I think it's worth it.<p>I also think Joel misses something: most programmers are bad programmers.  They'll dig you into holes, write lots of spaghetti string code, etc.  At least when they're using a framework there's some constraint on their madness.  Frameworks (generally) make it a tad difficult to work outside of their constraints and so the default becomes to work in that standard way.  So, you don't get people doing weird things as often - like building a string that is the page that they'll echo out like the piece of PHP I'm working on today does (guess they didn't realize that you could simply go out of PHP mode to do that).",1231852389

Individual mileage might vary. However, as most other people have already suggested, ""quickly building something"" (preferably something that you care about) and trying to improve upon it will make you a decent programmer. In the process of trying to improve upon it, you would have hopefully figured out what is wrong with the existing program, quickly learn from it and come up with a better evolved program/product.",1231852177
