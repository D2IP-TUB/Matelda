Neither has the proven stability or community that Apache does, and neither is going to help much if your bottlenecks are at the application layer, rather than just shooting raw bits over a network cable.",1212969411
212366,comment,212319,212319,0,0,brianlash,,,"So the message here is:<p>A guy who's associated with a company who made an investment in Facebook, is formerly associated with the National Venture Capial Association (most VCs are), is associated with another obscure character who's associated with a VC firm which itself is associated with the CIA...<p>...did I get that right?<p>This is typical conspiracy theory bunk.  Because every character in this case -- persons and firms -- has itself 10's of thousands of contacts, the possible stories you can create by virtue of <i>who</i> each knows is exponential.  So the meaning of any single association -- CIA + Facebook here -- becomes less and less compelling the further you move through the already-fragile associations.<p>As an aside consider this: should you be judged for knowing someone who has at one time herself known a murderer, a rapist, a prostitue, or a drug dealer?  What if you know someone who knows someone like that?  The curious statistical thing is, it's almost certainly the case that you do.<p>I don't mean to trivialize the importance of privacy of information.  I just mean to make the case that if there is a decent case against FB and the threat it poses to users' privacy, this isn't it.",1212969295

It only has to be as painful and slow as you make it when you use it. I hope you have a chance to revisit it sometime with a modern framework like Code Igniter or CakePHP. I used to have a shade of the type of biases you show now, but after we've made half a dozen MVC web apps using Code Igniter (and Django) I've had to change my tune.<p>Best of luck to you.",1212968789

It's one reason I've almost entirely cut juice and sugar from my morning intake because it nicely explains the mid-morning crash. Even lightly processed cereals are not very good for you. It seems to be much better (physically and mentally) to get complex carbs (look for more fiber and less sugar) with fresh fruit (for fiber and sweetness) and perhaps a bit of protein/fat (nuts are really, really good).
