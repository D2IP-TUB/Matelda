As ARM chips hit that sweet spot of say 2 GHz and say 3-4 cores, they'll hit laptops and it will be game over. Why would a company pay $100 for an AMD chip that is a 50 watt or 100 watt chip when an ARM chip might be 5 watt and $10?<p>Once chips hit the ""good enough"" threshold where they perform well enough that the average user doesn't notice the increased performance, it becomes more of an issue of economics and $10-15 ARM chips are at a huge advantage over $100+ chips from AMD and Intel.<p>Also, Apple is certainly working on an ARM version of full OSX (as iOS is already basically OSX on ARM), Android obviously runs on ARM, Linux runs on ARM, and WinRT runs on ARM, so all of the major OS's can/do support ARM. Thus, there's not a major barrier software wise for ARM, it's more of a performance barrier, which won't likely last more than 3 years.<p>To AMD's credit, they're working on ARM for servers, but ARM is going to eat their whole business, so they need to move as fast in that direction as they can afford to. x86 is going to die a lot faster than anyone could imagine.",1354976162
