While the series has never been an MMO in a strict sense, online play has always been more engaging (except for rampant spamming... which Blizzard seriously needs to address). Sites like d2jsp.org will attest to the added depth of online play. An economy developed out of the items you could find and there was also high end game play that was only available online. The experience was clearly superior.<p>Lots of people are going to jump all over Blizzard for it, but this move was entirely predictable and makes sense. What do you gain by playing offline: less restrictions and less gameplay. While some people will disagree with me, it is akin to asking for an offline component to WoW or EVE: there's technically a game left, but without other people there's much less fun and enjoyment.",1312339380

In this case I think you've reduced a complicated situation to a nifty sounding catch phrase that appeals to our libertarian leanings (even mine).<p>I used to manage a high-volume retail game store (~3m in yearly sales, $30 at a time). Many gamers literally do spend all of their disposable income on the games, and pirate what they cannot afford (and surprise, huge swaths of the gamer population are poor as dirt, and with the amount of time and money they spend on games this isn't changing). This kind of DRM would exist if 1 person or 1million people were pirating games, because its the only secure solution.<p>I don't think this kind of DRM will be successful in improving PC sales in general. The only reason Blizzard gets away with it is because their games will always be at the top of gamer's purchase lists. They are high quality products with a shitload of content and beautiful user interfaces. If every game company followed suite, I don't think the result would be successful.<p>edit, and context: I don't really care what Blizzard does to protect their games. People were concerned about Starcraft 2, the required online connectivity hasn't affected my game experience at all in the last year. I think this will probably be true for D3, as well.",1312339079

The compile time should be attributed to the compiler, of course, but VS has a habit of invoking the compiler unnecessarily, even if no source has changed.<p>I don't really use the WYSIWIG aspects either but <i>all</i> aspects of the UI seem slow and cluttered in my experience. And whether or not you and I use those aspects of the IDE is somewhat immaterial. It is called <i>Visual</i> Studio after all and touts the visual designers.<p>My point regarding the specs of my dev machine were that it is a fairly decent, new machine and the load being placed on it really isn't that high. Comparatively I run XCode on a 4 year old laptop with 2GB RAM, slower disk, slower processor and it is far more responsive. (And FWIW the compiler is faster too, especially now they are using LLVM).<p>When I say the IDE doesn't make a difference to the level of polish you can apply to an application what I'm trying to say is that if you're writing mostly textual code as I do too, then the IDE doesn't really factor into the polish of the application. Although, I suppose I'm contradicting myself as if I'm more productive in XCode then I have more time available to polish, so there is an indirect relationship there :P<p>At the end of the day, they're both decent tools and and everyone will have their preference. My comment was really just because a lot of people have started using XCode in recent years, having moved from VS due to the ""iPhone effect"" and I see an awful lot of comments and posts about how much better VS is, and my experience contradicts that :)",1312338800

Education market, I guess?<p>The Netduino is $39 (admittedly, GHIs other smaller ""non-gadgeteer"" FEZ products compete with that), Netduino Plus (ethernet/SD) is $59, but the FEZ does have a ton more features than either.<p>And I guess presumably we can expect more ""gadgeteer clones"" in the next year or so.<p>As for Arduino's market dominance, it seems like suitability/competitiveness really depends on what you want to build. This stuff is several levels up in terms of abstraction and features. Some projects will embrace that, for some it'll just be window dressing.<p>Regarding development tools, TI has a really convenient USB-driven live debugger for their MSP platform, AFAIK including the Launchpad boards. Arduino is still the market leader, despite an absolutely bare-bones (but dead simple) IDE. Maybe Visual Studio tools will tip the balance, I don't know.<p>It'll be an interesting space to watch, that's for sure.",1312338146
