If you are a member of the capital class, then you &quot;own&quot; various &quot;resources&quot;, like fields and vehicles and water and ideas, and if a poor person tries to access those &quot;resources&quot; the government steps in and uses violence against the poor person until they stop. If you sit down to write any sort of definition of &quot;property&quot; that&#x27;s more or less what you&#x27;re going to arrive at.<p>Maybe you can point me at what part of this picture you&#x27;re hesitant to acknowledge?",1399874292

It all depends on everybody carrying their own weight, though, and of all, that seems to be the farthest away concept so far. Phones and other mobile devices are consuming an increasingly sizeable chunk of the pool and those devices are barely able to connect and to their work, much less work for others due to battery restrictions, which are ultimately bound by the laws of physics.<p>This is also the reason Aether will most probably never have a mobile version.

It&#x27;s incredibly heartening to see YC set a great example because of their visibility and the amount of respect we all have for them in the tech/startup community. As someone who&#x27;s unsuccessfully worked on getting codes implemented, I think this is absolutely huge and predict others will do the right thing and follow suit.<p>I agree that this is pretty vague. I don&#x27;t think the more nitty gritty details (how to make an incident report, who&#x27;s responsible for handling it, etc.) have to be posted publicly, but hopefully the actual policy is being worked on behind the scenes.",1399871654

That ended pretty much by the late 1990s due to the ever growing onslaught of spam.<p>Today it can be (and often is) frustrating even for established companies to get their mail delivered to all sources.  I&#x27;ve had repeated frustrations especially with Yahoo, but also AOL (both continue to have a large number of addresses, if not active accounts -- problems in scrubbing old email addresses is another challenge).  Larger companies may have their own idiosyncrasies regarding accepting email -- even with SPF and DKIM records, I&#x27;ve not infrequently encountered companies (some of which, granted, do things involved making littler things out of little things called atoms) who requested (and presumably require) the specific IP address of our outbound mailservers for communications.<p>More generally, email badly wants to have some sort of reputation layer put on top of it, though how to accomplish this has eluded general solution (SPF and DKIM are only band-aids, and already break a lot of legacy behavior).  Total encryption would be good, including of headers.  It&#x27;s a bit of a mess.",1399871549

If you were to take a second and notice that there are large numbers of closed-source projects out there where the developers did not bother with any form of DRM at all, it should become obvious that you have chosen to attack a strawman.<p>You also have conveniently misrepresented my original complaint (and, I am pretty certain, goldenkey&#x27;s later elaboration): there is a difference between &quot;hoping for&quot; or &quot;encouraging&quot; something and indicating displeasure and expectation :(. &quot;it is too bad that comex didn&#x27;t give me $10&quot; is a fundamentally different statement than &quot;I would really appreciate it if comex gave me $10&quot;... even &quot;it would be really awesome if comex had given me $10&quot; is not a sufficient fix: it continues to imply a form of entitlement where it is not just subjectively but objectively bad that the speaker did not get what they wanted... that comex is actually doing something objectively bad (and worse, already in the past did something objectively bad: note that the tense also changes in those versions to did/had) by not giving me $10... this kind of attitude does, I believe, seem somewhat &quot;unreasonable&quot;.",1399871043
