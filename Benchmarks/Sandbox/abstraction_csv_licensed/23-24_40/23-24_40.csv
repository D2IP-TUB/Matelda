538015,comment,537944,537944,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That completely misses the point of why people vote, or buy green products, or help the homeless, or donate to charity, or do anything civic-minded.<p>It's true that one person basically does not make a difference in the grand scheme of things.  However, it makes a big difference <i>to that person</i>.  It's all about identity, and self-image, and all the intangible self-esteem thingies that you can't reduce down to rational behavior.<p>Same as with any branded behavior.  Why do people pay $5 for Starbucks coffee when they can make it for pennies at home?  Why do they pay double for Macs when you can get an Ubuntu machine that works nearly as well?  Why do they live in gigantic McMansions that cost a fortune to heat when they'll never use all the rooms?  It's all a way of saying ""I'm cooler than you"", and people will pay a lot to be cooler than their neighbors.  Personally, I think being green or civic-minded is a lot more productive expression of your self-identity than mindless consumerism.<p>Same reason that the Prius succeeded in the market while the Civic Hybrid and various diesel cars failed.  The Prius just screams ""I'm cooler than you"", with the sleek body, separate brand, keyless entry, electronic transmission, on-screen computer display, etc.  If you really want to be friendly to the environment, get a Jetta Diesel or a motorcycle or bike to work.  But those don't <i>announce</i> that you're being friendly to the environment the same way that driving a Prius does.  (Except at Google, where biking to work is one step cooler than driving a Prius, because everyone has a Prius.)  So they fail in the marketplace, which is all about ""What can this do for me?"" rather than ""What can this do for the environment?""",1238371073
538014,comment,537742,537909,0,0,geuis,,,"I definitely respect a fellow frontend developer, but your points don't really support using css hacks.<p>1) You shouldn't have duplicate copies of your stylesheet in multiple files. You have your core stylesheet(s) that have rules for all browsers. The only rules that should exist in your ie.css are the ones that specifically need to be over-ridden for IE to fix specific bugs. This obviates the need to have server-side scripts doing concat-magic, beyond minification on all stylesheets.<p>2) In general, I normally only have my style.css(served to all browsers) and one ie.css(served via conditional comments to any version of IE <= 7. 95% of the time, if something is broken in IE7, its also broken in IE6 and is fixed there. Very rare is the time that something that breaks in IE6 but not IE7 can't be fixed by stepping back and redesigning the structure slightly to obviate the perceived rendering bug completely. In the rare 5% of the time that IE6 and IE7 are both broken, but in different ways, and I can't conceive of a different way to eliminate the bug all together, then I will simply add another conditional stylesheet <i>only</i> for IE6. I think in the last 3 years, I've probably only had to do this 2-3 times. Its such an edge case, its simply not a problem in my day-to-day work.<p>3) The browser share at my last company(3-4 million visitors monthly) was 25% Firefox, 70% IE(24% IE6, 75% IE7, 1% IE8 beta), and 5% all others(Safari, Chrome, Opera). 30% of all our visitors would receive 1 stylesheet. Slightly less than 70% would get 2 stylesheets. However, while the general style.css could be any size depending on a site's needs, the IE-specific stylesheet was never larger than a few dozen css rules at <i>most</i>. aka, it was a tiny, tiny file usually less than 1k-3k. This is a minimum load for even an older browser like IE6 to handle.<p>4) In looking through <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yahoo.com</a>, there are no stylesheet <link>'s in the page structure. There is a ton of inline javascript and css though. By examining via Firebug, I see one <link> tag for a stylesheet. I'm concluding that it is being loaded into the DOM via js instead of being hardcoded. What I am also seeing is that since the css is being loaded inline, even though I'm on Firefox I am still getting the CSS hacks like underline, star, and alphaimageloader filters. Yes, these are ignored by my browser but I shouldn't being receiving them in the first place. Additionally, since the CSS is not being located in its own file(s), additional weight is being added to the page on every single page view. If the styles were being loaded, then they would be cached by my browser and I would not need to re-load that data again on subsequent pageviews.<p>There is always a valid point about extra objects in a page and the Yahoo homepage makes very few external requests(4 js files and 12 css background images). Its a highly-performant page. But in the interest of optimizing a site for <i>everyone</i> instead of the majority, putting stylesheets into separate files and using conditional comments does not put enormous extra load onto browsers. Even better, it gives me the page performance I want in my browser while giving the best performance possible for the users who(for whatever reason) are still using IE6.",1238370712

537997,comment,537346,537987,0,0,time_management,,,"""Even when <i>romantic love</i> is not linked with reproduction, this passion can provide a teen or young adult with some exceptional personal and social benefits, including exhilarating joy, increased energy and optimism, feelings of intimacy, self-esteem, inclusion in health-giving social groups, exercise, social and personal support, and crucial practice in the skills of building a long-term partnership—skills they will need to make the most important social contract of their reproductive lives."" (Emphasis mine.)<p>You missed that inconvenient detail, didn't you? Romantic love and casual sex are mutually exclusive. (I'm railing against <i>casual</i> sex, not all premarital sex; if the latter, I'd be a hypocrite.)<p><i>Women may be particularly vulnerable to falling in love with a casual sex partner because seminal fluid also contains dopamine and tyrosine, a building block of dopamine (Burch & Gallup, in press). Although these chemicals do not pass across the blood-brain barrier, elevated activities of dopamine and tyrosine may affect brain physiology through other complex interactions. In fact, people report that sex can lead to romantic love. The natives of rural Nepal even use an off-color term for this phenomenon, saying ""Naso pasyo, maya basyo,"" or ""the\npenis entered and love arrived"" (Ahearn, 1998).</i><p><i>Once again, this biological link between lust and romantic love is not direct or simple. Athletes who inject synthetic androgens to build muscle do not fall in love. When middle-aged men and women inject androgens or apply testosterone cream to stimulate their sex drive, their sexual thoughts and fantasies increase (Sherwin & Gelfand, 1987; Sherwin, Gelfand, & Brender, 1985). But neither do these individuals become enamored.</i><p><i>Nevertheless, the chemical interactions between testosterone and dopamine and the chemical changes that accompany sexual arousal suggest that those who engage in sexual intercourse are more likely to fall in love; their threshold for this passion is lowered. And women who engage in sex without a condom may be even more susceptible to romantic passion. Hence teens and young adults who pursue\n""casual sex"" with a friend or stranger can become enamored with their sexual partner even when they have no intention of beginning a romance.</i><p><i>Lust Can Trigger Attachment</i><p><i>Sexual activity can also trigger the brain system for attachment. In humans, orgasm elevates the activity of oxytocin and vasopressin (Carmichael et al., 1987; Young\net al., 1998); and these neuropeptides are associated with attachment in people and other animals (Wang, Ferris, & DeVries, 1994; Williams et al., 1994"" Young et al., 1998). ' B Hence, teenagers who engage in casual sex can trigger the brain system for attachment (as well as that for romantic love), </i>leading to complex, unanticipated emotional entanglements with psychologically and socially unsuitable mating partners."" (Emphasis mine.)<p>In other words, casual sex hacks the brain system, by aping at least some of the biochemical signature of romantic love. Of course, in most cases, it's not romantic love but a shallow infatuated attachment. In any case, it's not good for you.",1238369551
