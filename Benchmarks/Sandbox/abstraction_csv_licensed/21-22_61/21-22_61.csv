The iPhone 6 costs US$ 1129 and the iPhone 6 Plus costs US$ 1258.<p>Our minimum wage, in comparison, is US$ 254/Month. The average montly income on the country last year was around US$ 376.<p>Just those figures already show how is nearly impossible for most of us to have iPhones. Add to that our crime rate, and most of us that can afford one, won&#x27;t dare to do it in risk of losing it.<p>It&#x27;s sad that we see a lot of nice apps, some good ideas and we can&#x27;t even test it. I believe it&#x27;s the same for several countries around the world.<p>That said, if you really want your app to reach a global audience, support for Android is a no brainer. I find the &quot;Android users buy less&quot; excuse not really acceptable, because the marrket is much bigger.<p>And I don&#x27;t see that scenario changing in Apple&#x27;s direction, because Windows Phone is growing a lot on developing countries, and it&#x27;s the second operating system is almost every south american country.  In Colombia, Windows Phone already have 25% of the market share. In Brazil, 6%, while iOS have 4,7%.",1434837428

Sometimes that second guessing is what keeps the conflict from becoming hot.  Spying can compromise a country&#x27;s defense to the extent another country feels comfortable attacking.  Also, if a weaker country can maintain the facade of strength it&#x27;s less likely to be attacked.<p>The most obvious example is when one country manages to uncover another country&#x27;s nuclear assets to such a high degree of confidence it feels (rightly or wrongly) it can make a 100% successful first strike.",1434837225

9751130,comment,9750797,9750959,0,0,tzs,,,"Based on what I read on one of their FAQs, it is not as good as a secure enclave, but it is quite a bit better than simply not providing a show password option.<p>The password is not stored on the devices of the people you share with. It&#x27;s stored on Microsoft servers. When the device someone you have shared with notices that a network you&#x27;ve shared is available, it gets the key to connect, then presumably forgets it.<p>I wonder if it is possible to do better? The idea would be that when setting up the connection (so, setting up session keys and authenticating) the device could pass these packet through to Microsoft&#x27;s server. Microsoft&#x27;s server could then calculate the response packets and give them to the device to relay to the access point. When the connection set up is all done, Microsoft&#x27;s server could pass the session key to the device, and subsequent packets would be handled entirely on the device.<p>There are two (at least) things that could torpedo this kind of approach. (1) the protocols might work in such a way that you cannot hand off the setup/authentication, or they might require frequent enough re-keying that spotty cell access could prevent keeping wifi working, and (2) the connection setup and authentication might be handled in firmware that does not provide a low enough level interface to do the fiddling needed.",1434836376

Sam&#x27;s behavior is not an indictment of American society or her parents. In the article, her parents care deeply for her. They were extremely concerned about her health, and only allowed her to run again once doctors deemed her fainting benign.<p>I agree that allowing her to run is a little dangerous, but it&#x27;s important to compare it to other risks we accept in high school sports. It&#x27;s not worse than say... pole vaulting. On average, pole vaulting kills one high schooler every year in the US. Dozens suffer traumatic brain injuries. Football casualties are even worse. Distance running is quite tame in comparison, even if one is predisposed to fainting.<p>Now if you&#x27;re wondering why someone would subject themselves to fainting, you should also wonder why anyone competes in athletics at all. It seems crazy to spend so much time training and suffering just for a silly medal. I ran competitively in high school and college, and I agree. It <i>is</i> crazy.<p>That&#x27;s why you see this sort of behavior in top athletes. There is a <i>huge</i> selection effect. You do not get to the top 0.01% without the right combination of genes, training, and borderline-monomania. Well-balanced people don&#x27;t win races. I once asked my high school coach what the best personality for distance running was. He grinned and replied, &quot;Sadomasochist. You have to enjoy pain and enjoy inflicting it on others.&quot; He was only half-joking.<p>So take it easy on Sam&#x27;s parents and US culture. Both seem quite interested in letting her pursue her desires as safely as is feasible.<p><pre><code>    ---\n</code></pre>\nSide note: If you&#x27;re curious just how competitive my running was, my high school PRs were: Mile: 4:18. 2 mile: 9:07. 5k: 15:09. I also ran a 3k in 8:32, which was (for high school) the 11th-fastest time in the US that year. I was captain of my high school&#x27;s XC team, which was the best in Washington state[1].<p>In high school, 3-4 hours of each day was lost to training. By college, it was almost a full-time job. I was running 100+ miles a week. It wasn&#x27;t long before I was constantly fighting overuse injuries, so I quit competing. NCAA Division I is a meat grinder.
