A few women will be on board with the campaign, but most women will feel like they're being ""sold"" to the men without really liking that idea.  Secondarily, doubling the women/men ratio won't come close to doubling any particular guy's chances of having sex.  So it's unfair and misleading to almost everyone.",1285462678

(I didn't downvote you BTW).<p>I think the problem is that the world simply cannot sustain the entirety of its population living with first-world standards. Better medicine in developing countries makes this worse since they now have as many children as before, but more of them survive - taking up resources. The global warming alarmists are probably keen to bring down the standards of the first world and handing it over to the rest of the world via carbon credits and the like.

There's an ecosystem of tools available for turning a Perl package into an RPM or deb, some of which can even work recursively.  Even before the YAML was standard in CPAN packages, it just wasn't that hard to parse out all the ""use"" and ""require"" statements to automatically detect all the required packages (and minimum versions of those).  There's also a unit testing framework to make sure you don't accidentally introduce any incompatibilities with untested newer versions of required packages.<p>I haven't dealt with Ruby quite as much, but the gem format also includes dependency information and there's gem2rpm for RPM and dpkg-gem for deb packages.<p>I think I've only ever once had to build an RPM or deb package of a Python package, but Python seems to natively support building both formats; just call the same ""build and install"" method you'd usually use with an extra argument and you get a native package, which will use dependency information if the python package provided it.",1285462401

Does it need to make a full page request to get the new items?  This will needlessly inflate pageview numbers in that case (I'm sure the ""fix"" for that will be that Microsoft will change the User Agent to say that it's not the browser but rather than pinned menu making the request).  As for implementation, does the browser create the menu from the this and it's static?

For example, Steam and hardware DRM on game consoles combat the piracy that is otherwise endemic to games and helped drive traditional PC game developers away from single-player games.<p>HDCP is an example of the opposite extreme. It punishes paying customers, while providing no benefit to content owners unless all other, easier forms of piracy were eradicated. It's pointless to worry about someone cracking hdmi when every available Bluray has already been cracked.<p>The key is that good DRM systems should invisible to paying users. Circumventing them should be just difficult enough that users are motivated to pay.",1285459704

This isn't exactly mainstream Top 40 stuff either. If someone is taking the time to go find bands to follow they're at least somewhat engaged in the service. For example Band of Horses has ~316,000 followers on FaceBook -- they have ~30,000 on Ping in less than a month. Considering FaceBook has 5x as many users as registered iTunes users this is an impressive start.",1285459671
