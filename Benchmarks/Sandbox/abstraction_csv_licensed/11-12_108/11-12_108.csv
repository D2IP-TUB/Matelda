LibreOffice is simply not compatible enough. Though, people are moving more and more to Google Docs, so this issue might disappear in the future.<p>- No GUI isolation in Linux. It scares the hell out of me that any application can read any other applications keystrokes, mouse events and viewports. When you have some vulnerability in some client (browser, mail), it could listen in on passwords that you type in a terminal as well. AFAIR Wayland will solve this. But the ecosystem did not move there yet.<p>- The lack of consistent keyboard shortcuts across applications.<p>- Supposedly stable upgrades that break stuff (especially in Ubuntu and to some extend RHEL, never had this problem in my many years with Slackware).<p>- The lack of cutting-edge hardware with good driver support. I love my 12&quot; MacBook and wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to anything heavier and worse keyboard/trackpad.<p>For other users, I can imagine that these are also problems:<p>- Installing applications outside the distribution&#x27;s repositories is still unnecessarily hard.<p>- There is a lot of inertia - people do not want to invest the time to learn something new.<p>- Business my still have many older win32 applications that do not run on other systems.<p>---<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t think the traditional Linux desktop or Mac OS X are serious threats to Windows. It&#x27;s Chrome, Chrome OS, Android, and iOS.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t want to sound too negative about desktop Linux.

It resonates with me.<p>I think an important distinction in procrastination, that was not explored in this article, is that a task has to be started or at least prepared in order to successfully procrastinate upon it. For example, it won&#x27;t help to put off finishing a university assignment until the last minute if you haven&#x27;t read the task description. In that case, the thought processes that were mentioned in the article would never have a chance to start. On the other hand, if you have read a task description, even if you are procrastinating while binge-watching Netflix, a background process is still running and working on the task. The author of this article describes it as &quot;Our first ideas, after all, are usually our most conventional&quot; vs &quot;When you procrastinate, you’re more likely to let your mind wander.&quot;<p>This ties in with a work methodology that works for me very well. Instead of working on a project non-stop as soon as it starts, I prefer to work in small chunks that give me enough time to &quot;background-process&quot; the task at hand while I&#x27;m not working on the given task. It is similar to practicing or physical exercise, in that the time that you spend on the activity is as important as the time that you are not spending on the activity.

Here&#x27;s my attempt to understand it:<p>First the title,<p><pre><code>  &quot;Why Musicians Need Philosophy&quot; \n</code></pre>\ncan be mentally rewritten as<p><pre><code>  &quot;Why Musicians Need [An Aesthetic] Philosophy [to understand and counteract the Modernist Philosophy]&quot;\n</code></pre>\nEssentially, he&#x27;s saying that music that is created from emphasizing the &quot;meta&quot; aspect (e.g. modernism or abstraction) rather than composing aural landscapes that please the ear is a form of <i>second rate philosophy</i>.<p>To support his position, he&#x27;s claiming that something like the diatonic scales with its divisions is deeply rooted in humanity and not purely arbitrary culture.  One can create music that works with this, or one can go &quot;meta&quot; and deliberately avoid it (e.g. atonal for ambiguity&#x27;s sake).  John Cage&#x27;s &quot;4&#x27;33&quot;[1] seems to be the common go-to example of meta music.<p>This same type of &quot;meta&quot; philosophy argument can be applied to art and literature.  Art that &quot;obviously&quot; pleases the eye (such as Michelangelo and da Vinci) isn&#x27;t all there is to art.  The artists can &quot;break the 4th wall&quot; (aka &quot;meta&quot;) and push the boundaries of abstractions. The art can draw attention to its medium and materials or try to ignore it. An artist can put a rectangle on the wall with a layer of silver particles covered by a sheet of glass and insist this is <i>art</i>.  You as the viewer just see &quot;a ordinary mirror&quot;.  The artist (and his high-brow allies) then explains that you don&#x27;t &quot;get it&quot; because there&#x27;s more to the &quot;reflection&quot;.  You can see your face in an infinity of Mona Lisas etc.  You as a viewer should not be constrained by a &quot;canvas&quot; or &quot;pigments&quot;.   Other examples might be a plain white canvas with a single dot in the middle.  Or it could be a painted line -- and it happens to sell for $44 million[2].  The famous urinal[3] is another piece that invites analysis and commentary.  Is all of this &quot;art&quot;?  Or &quot;philosophy&quot; packaged as art?  You decide.<p>Discussing avante garde art/music/literature can get really weird and you don&#x27;t know if people are trolling each other with Poe&#x27;s Law.[4]<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://twentytwowords.com/canvas-painted-blue-with-a-white-line-sells-for-nearly-44-million-4-pictures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twentytwowords.com/canvas-painted-blue-with-a-white-l...</a><p>[3]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)</a><p>[4]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law</a>",1453029854

Erlang is probably the safest because of only immutable data, but you can still deadlock there.<p>The Observer pattern which is shown here can be especially tricky. Once you register a callback for an event you don&#x27;t necessarily know from which thread the callback will be called. Some libraries will fire callbacks from a worker thread, other might marshal them to some kind of main thread, etc. If callbacks are fired from multiple threads then event ordering won&#x27;t be guaranteed and you probably need locking in the receiver (be aware of deadlocks). The next tricky thing is cancellation/unsubscription. In most multithreaded implementations you might still get notifications shortly after unsubscribe during special timing conditions if the thread that fires the notification has not yet processed the unsubscription (or operates on a copied and outdated subscriber list).<p>A singlethreaded runtime (like node) makes reasoning around this much easier.
