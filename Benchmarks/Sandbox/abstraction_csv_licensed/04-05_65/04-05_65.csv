8280390,comment,8278716,8278716,4,0,quarterwave,,,"This is a beautiful post, and I am reluctant to try and say anything profound. Still, all of HN&#x27;s a stage so I&#x27;ll attempt a brief explanation for the general reader about why we need voltage regulators.<p>A logic chip like a microprocessor is designed for a particular supply voltage, if this voltage drops too much the logic circuitry will switch falsely. Say we had only a capacitor and we tried to power the logic chip with it. As the chip draws current the capacitor discharges - this is because current is movement of charge, so the charge (and energy) can come only by draining the capacitor. For an ideal capacitor the voltage is directly proportional to the charge across it, so as the charge drains the voltage falls. To hold the voltage constant we need to keep &#x27;topping up&#x27; the capacitor with charge. This is what a voltage regulator does - it uses a negative feedback loop to sense the capacitor voltage and when that voltage falls the circuit provides just the right amount of charge &#x27;juice&#x27; for the top-up.<p>As we take the foot off the clutch pedal in a car, the load gets engaged to the engine and if we sense a stall we press the gas pedal a bit. That&#x27;s the imagery of a voltage regulator in action.<p>The capacitor plays a key role because the regulator feedback loop isn&#x27;t very fast - one trouble with fast feedback circuits is chatter, or responding to every blip. Negative feedback circuits are designed to be more like ship wheels - they like to steer sedately and not respond to every excited cry from the mast. But what happens if a current blip arises because a logic circuit block turns on all at once (in response to some block of code)? That local current blip is provided by the capacitor, it acts like an ATM to provide local draws - but it still depends on the regulator to top it up.<p>In fact you can think of a battery as a capacitor that tops itself up via electrochemistry, it works as long as there are ions in the electrolyte. If instead of &#x27;bandgap energy&#x27; we used the chemist&#x27;s terminology of &#x27;electrochemical potential difference&#x27;, then the system similarity becomes evident.",1410065908
8280389,comment,8273908,8275530,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"If <i>all</i> classes are basically strictly scoped, encapsulated components, targeted in the CSS via parent chains, then you won&#x27;t have this problem, and you won&#x27;t fall into the trap you describe.<p>For example, rather than having .buy, it would be named something like .NavigationBar_buy (ie., following a ComponentName_child naming convention) and it would be declared in NavigationBar.scss and look like something like:<p><pre><code>    .NavigationBar > .NavigationBar_buy {\n      @include button(large, red);\n      margin-left: 15px;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe really nice thing about the mixin approach is that you will be able to <i>trace all usage</i>. After all, a huge problem with CSS is class rot (where you don&#x27;t know which classes are actually being used by the app) and class leakage (where classes are used for unrelated things in surprising ways that break if you modify it not knowing about the potential side-effects). Whereas in a component/mixin system, the dependencies are crystal clear: if a mixin isn&#x27;t used in the stylesheet, you <i>know</i> it&#x27;s not used by the page, and similarly, you know exactly which classes map to which components. You may get some rot, but zero leakage, and the rot is carefully contained. The only downside is increased HTML/CSS size.<p>Class-based CSS doesn&#x27;t scale to large teams, in my opinion. A strictly enforced design manual might do it, but I don&#x27;t think most companies can work that way.",1410065882

It&#x27;s great for post-hoc rationalization of your feelings, and decent for communicating ideas about personality to people, but the actual four-factor with subfactor test is snake oil.

8280373,comment,8279370,8279903,1,0,byuu,,,"Thanks, the is_compatible test certainly gave me a good bit of trouble.<p>Ideally you&#x27;d want to do enable_if< conditionA || conditionB >, but of course if one of the conditions fails to evaluate, the overload is ignored. So you have to split out the conditions and them merge them back together later on.<p>We could use true_type / false_type, but they have equivalent sizes. So unlike the function version that only needs one test and can just take the return type directly, the test at the end would then have to become std::is_same<decltype(test1<U>(0)), std::true_type>::value | std::is_same<decltype(test2<U>(0)), std::true_type>::value.<p>I still think we can do better than even this, so I&#x27;ll have to keep working at it.",1410065213

Increasing the number of multicast entries on the switch to something larger, say, around 30,000 entries combined with reducing the length of time in which a privacy address is valid (and therefore requiring a group) from one day, to say, one hour?",1410064883

We were a little worried that we wouldn&#x27;t be selecting the fruits and vegetables ourselves but they have excellent quality control.  We&#x27;ve never been disappointed with a delivery.<p>The thing is, they do it right.  Once they get the orders, they go directly to the farms and get exactly what they need for delivery each day.  That way they never have to deal with spoilage.  And they can be picky about the product they buy and later deliver to their customers.  And to top it all off, they offer free delivery and are still usually cheaper than shopping at the grocery store.  I believe this is profitable for them because they don&#x27;t have to deal with spoilage.",1410063326

8280325,comment,8279081,8280103,7,0,mschoch,,,"Thanks for taking an interest.<p>I would say that we&#x27;re most comparable to Lucene, given that we&#x27;re a library not a server.  But, we&#x27;re also very much not a port of Lucene to go.  That already exists, and someone has posted that link elsewhere in this thread.  I&#x27;ve worked a fair amount with Elasticsearch, so a lot of the higher level API is inspired by it.  And thats one of the biggest differences between Bleve and Lucene today.  Lucene is pretty low-level.  The bleve top-level API works a lot more like Elasticsearch (specifically there is a mapping, its serialized and stored in the index).  There is a lower level that looks more like Lucene (everything is just documents and fields), and the top-level API builds on top of that.<p>That is I would say the primary goal of Bleve, to be a great text indexing and search library for Go.<p>Next you asked about a REST interface.  Bleve ships with HTTP handlers in a sub-package.  These are completely optional, you can use Bleve without them, or you could write your own if you don&#x27;t like these.  There is a not-quite-done-yet example app that uses these to make it look a lot like a single-node Elasticsearch.  But, its just an example app, I have no immediate plans to try to turn this into a production app.<p>Regarding scaling beyond a single embedded instance...  Obviously there is a lot of interest in this area.  The way I&#x27;m looking at this right now is that this is simply a layer above Bleve, much as Elasticsearch/Solr provide this as a layer above Lucene.  There are a few enhancements we could add to streamline this, like allowing the Searches to operate across multiple indexes.<p>My hope is that lots of apps spring up around Bleve.  Maybe someone wires up the HTTP handlers and Raft and makes an Elasticsearch clone.  Maybe people will do something I don&#x27;t expect.  Will we go there?  Not right now, we&#x27;ve got our hands full.  But if we do, it will be in a separate project, built on top of Bleve.",1410063249

It&#x27;s new enough that it&#x27;s almost sorta kinda possible to get it on the internet, yet also old enough that it&#x27;s somewhere between an adventure and a PITA to do so, and pretty challenging to do anything vaguely useful with it once you do.<p>I don&#x27;t know as much about the nitty gritty details as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s damn cool that I can now write 1 line of Ruby that fires off a query at a web server somewhere, gets a JSON reply, parses it into a Hash, and delivers it back to me, doing roughly a kazillion hugely complex things along the way.

I built a CPU in an FPGA that used a construction similar to a cache line to hold registers as an experiment once. The one line (64 bytes) was &#x27;reserved&#x27; for 16 registers (8 GP, 4 index, and 4 process specific (SP, PC, STATUS, MODE)), a context switch reloaded the registers as it reloaded the cache. That made context switching a bit faster than a full on push/pop stream but not as fast as having dedicated register banks ala SPARC.<p>These last two posts by Colin though really got me thinking about the who push for a &#x27;trusted computing base&#x27; that folks had back in the 90s.
