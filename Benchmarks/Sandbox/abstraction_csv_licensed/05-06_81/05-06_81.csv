It is exceedingly common for performance sensitive applications in GC environments not to allocate either, because quite simply allocating/deallocating in any environment is expensive.<p>Why in the world is it fair to compare C/C++ programs that don&#x27;t allocate to Java/C# ones that do?  Another way of saying this is if you are using <i>new</i> ubiquitously then you obviously do not care about performance <i>prima facie</i>.<p>At the end of the day GC&#x27;d versus manual memory debates seem to fall into 2 axis.  Complexity vs correctness and total memory available vs concurrent access to said memory.<p>At this point in time the difference in performance between a C application and a Java one comes down to correctness and access to low level memory layout primitives, not GC vs manual memory.",1436507188

I think it&#x27;s been almost a year since Signal for iOS came out - yet still no word on Signal for Android.<p>What is taking so long, if you don&#x27;t mind me asking? Is there some sort of Signal 3.0 overhaul planned for all the platforms along with a big launch?<p>Also, I think you&#x27;ve been quite retreated in the past year or so, I assume so you can focus on working. But I believe you should personally get more involved in promoting your apps (as you do in this piece here). Go on more TV shows, podcasts and so on. Look how much Telegram has grown, not because it&#x27;s any better than Signal (far from it), but because they&#x27;ve actively promoted themselves and took a more pro-active role in building a community.<p>More mainstream users need to know that &quot;Skype is not secure, but Signal is&quot; - which reminds me - I hope Signal will eventually get encrypted video-chat support as well, to make it a true alternative to Skype (and of course a desktop app, but I know your team has been working on that).<p>To monetize the apps have you considered trying to get Signal into enterprise, as a much more secure alternative to what enterprise customers are currently using, and then get paid for support? Or do you believe that would complicate things too much and make the apps worse off in the end?",1436506756

9862449,comment,9861793,9861793,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Interesting article and interesting guy. I like the work he and his team does on these apps. Unfortunately, they typically run on the type of endpoints that everyone from script kiddies with money to High Strength Attackers can hit. Usually alongside apps not as strong as theirs on TCB&#x27;s that can at best be described as insecure foundations.<p>I recommend against such apps and platforms for anything other than stopping the riff raff. That&#x27;s what I use them for. I pointed out the difference between secure code and secure systems in this [1] writeup. Shared much of my framework for analyzing or designing-in security in the process. The TCB of most solutions today is ridiculous: people are building on foundations of quicksand. There&#x27;s only a few exceptions I&#x27;ve seen such as GenodeOS (architecturally) or Markus Ottela&#x27;s Tinfoil Chat. Markus has been unusually alert to our concerns and updated his app appropriately even for covert, channel suppression. Quick question: which of the many crypto apps on the market can deliver a covert channel analysis to you at app and system level? Answer: few to none despite it&#x27;s importance over decades with a rediscovery in past 5+ years in mainstream security.<p>Strong security is hard. Moxie seems awesome as a coder and good to great in both crypto and OPSEC. Thing is, his offerings break the decades old rule of having a strong TCB. Just like most of the rest. It&#x27;s why they&#x27;re usually bypassed or broken by strong attackers. Gotta do the whole thing with concern for each aspect of the system. TFC is a clever cheat on that even more than my MILS scheme with a KVM and a highly-assured guard. If you don&#x27;t cheat around it, you better do it right or your users will suffer the consequences. Those <i>trying</i> to contain vulnerabilities of mainstream OS&#x27;s and components with any success are expending literally hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of labor per year. It&#x27;s why I push for clean-slate, hardware and software platforms like DARPA and NSF have been funding recently (eg SAFE, CHERI processors). Alternatives using COTS tech are pretty complex and most users will probably fail to secure them to be honest.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/essay_on_fbi-ma.html#c1102869"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/essay_on_fbi-...</a>",1436506616

China has an almost complete ban on civilian ownership of firearms. The only exception is for rare hunting permits (there is very little hunting in China) and wildlife conservation. Even then traditional hunting tends to use blackpowder muzzle loaders (and they restrict ownership of black/gun powder)<p>They don&#x27;t even allow regular cops to use useful firearms (they are issued a revolver that fires rounds with as much energy as a .22 LR ... enough to wound but not kill or even stop someone attacking police). They don&#x27;t want the cops ever rebelling against the PLA.<p>The BBC wants us to believe that Chinese authorities allowed an armed militia to directly challenge law enforcement and did nothing about it for over a decade?<p>More likely that was just a story made up by bribed cops, cops who were shit scared of going into that village or cops/politicians who wanted extra credit for going into that village.<p>So I wonder how much else of this story is exaggerated by the journalist.<p>Fully automatic AK ownership, and even grenade ownership is fully legal in many or most US states, if you pay the required BATFE taxes and have the right permits (explosive storage permits for grenades) but so much wave one at a cop and you will be surrounded by armored cars and black helicopters sooner that you can blink.",1436506466
