I'm not particularly a fan of abstracting abstractions in the first place so I'm probably biased, but I find jQuery to be clean and concise already. An example from the article:<p>$.post(<p><pre><code>  ""/posts/update_title""\n\n  new_title: input.val()\n\n  id: something\n\n  -> alert('done')\n\n  'json'\n</code></pre>\n)<p>All coffeescript really did there was remove the commas and subtly change the syntax. That's not an improvement at all, it's just a lateral syntax change. If anything, the lack of commas almost makes it harder to read.<p>Why change to coffeescript and add another step (compilation of coffeescripts) into the mix when jquery was already pretty good to start with?
