For men, it was essentially remember to <i>wear clothing</i>, don&#x27;t dress like an investment banker, and you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>For women, it was paragraphs long. Too feminine and they&#x27;ll mistake you for a departmental secretary. Too youthful and they&#x27;ll dismiss you as a student. Too severe and you&#x27;re &quot;not collegial&quot;. Too approachable and you&#x27;re not serious. The whole thing was just a minefield.",1425621529

Albeit, it is wrong to expect any magical words that can shift your direction completely, but still I am not sure how much value do printed ideas provide vs learning them by experience. I am not implying that books like it are futile but I don&#x27;t buy that they are &quot;career-changing&quot;.<p>Same goes for reading about Design Patterns.

You didn&#x27;t see how one could usefully apply their work. I&#x27;m explaining how I have applied it. You asked &quot;Why in the first instance do you give your negative assessment credence, and have doubts about your positive assessment in the second?&quot; When I say, &quot;It&#x27;s about how one strives to improve,&quot; I am answering your question.<p>> i think our disagreement stems from me applying it from a neutral ability perspective and you applying it to your own self assessment, where you don&#x27;t question your basic competency.<p>Not at all. If for X I am a person of low ability, then I am likely to perceive myself as doing pretty well at X because I cannot see the flaws in my work. So if I&#x27;m at a state where my work looks good to me, the thing to do is, as I said, to improve my discernment until I can see flaws in my work. Then I can work to improve, increasing my competency.<p>This strategy works no matter what you relative competence is. And note that relative competence is distinct from absolute competence. Even people in the top quartile of a given sample can keep improving, and I believe Glass&#x27;s quote helps explain why: their taste is still ahead of their skill, which if they keep practicing yields increased absolute competence.",1425619749

9155708,comment,9153551,9155507,0,0,mdasen,,,"If people are curious, some of it comes down to the techniques and algorithms that each implement.  This information might be a little out of date and I&#x27;m doing this from memory so please pardon/correct any inaccuracies.<p>So, with joins, MySQL uses loop joins.  These are often expensive compared to hash or merge joins.  PostgreSQL&#x27;s query planner can choose which of the three join strategies will have the lowest estimated cost.  I believe MariaDB has implemented hash joins.  I&#x27;m sure there are cool visualizations of the different join types that you could watch in action and see how they&#x27;d perform differently.<p>MySQL (with InnoDB) uses a clustered (index-oriented) table layout.  Basically, it keeps the table in a B-tree and so querying by the primary key becomes nice and fast since the physical data layout of the table is in that lookup order and successive rows are likely to be in the same disk block.  But this means that if you&#x27;re looking up something in a secondary index, you then have to traverse the primary index (going through two trees).  Databases like SQL Server and Oracle let you choose your table layout, but MySQL and PostgreSQL only support one (MySQL giving you clustered and PostgreSQL giving you heap).<p>MySQL has supported covering indexes for a while, but PostgreSQL has only added this capability recently.  A covering index means that you don&#x27;t have to read data from the underlying table if you only need columns that are included in the index (since all of the data is in the index).<p>Ultimately with databases, the key is limiting the amount of time wasted waiting for the disk.  If you can cut down on the number of disk blocks you need to fetch to fulfil a query, you win!  There are lots of things like these that databases do to try and get better performance (some doing more, some doing less, and some that involve trade-offs) and they&#x27;re often quite reasonable to understand.",1425618712

The jokes made were not threatening or sexist, and if she felt threatened, her feelings were not justified.<p>Women are just as capable of reasoning as men, but they&#x27;re also just as capable of being wrong. There are real sexism issues to address in the software industry. At a conference a few years ago, a coworker of mine was followed back to her hotel room by a drunk conference attendee--THAT is sexist and threatening. At a Ruby conference, a presenter showed slides of women in bikinis and made lewd comments about them--THAT is sexism. I don&#x27;t think inventing a sexism issue where there isn&#x27;t one does anything to solve the real problems.<p>To be clear: I do think that it is productive to look at what the software industry is doing wrong in relation to women. All I&#x27;m saying is that this particular instance is a red herring.<p>>  It&#x27;s not normal for her to have felt this way and I don&#x27;t blame her for experiencing that.<p>I don&#x27;t blame her either, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any conclusions to be drawn from how she felt.

Her response to Hank&#x27;s original Hacker News comment was quite pleasant and seemed to acknowledge that bad situations can happen even though Hank is a good guy.<p>One can be sane, gainfully employed, well-spoken, and calm, and still wrong. I think any sane, gainfully employed, well-spoken, calm person will freely admit that they have been wrong many times.<p>> Yet she felt threatened by an innocuous joke because of the atmosphere of the conference, because she was vastly outnumbered, and because we are unwilling to address this.<p>What about the atmosphere of the conference made her feel threatened? If there was something that happened at the conference which was actually threatening, <i>that</i> is the problem, not these jokes. If there is threatening behavior going on, I&#x27;d love to figure out a way to stop it. But jokes about dongles and forking repos are not threatening behavior, and pretending they are does nothing to solve anything.<p>Yes, she&#x27;s vastly outnumbered.

Just because people don&#x27;t agree with her doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t listening.<p>> Almost everyone here dismisses them out-of-hand, how is that attractive or inclusive?<p>Sure, we can lower our standards to include people who can&#x27;t differentiate between something threatening and something non-threatening, and that might allow us to hire more women.
