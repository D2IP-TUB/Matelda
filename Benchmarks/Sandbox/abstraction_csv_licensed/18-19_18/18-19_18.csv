Take Ambien, for example.  The studies show it works!  People who take it fall asleep a whole 15 minutes sooner than placebo!  For thousands of dollars and unquantified long term consequences you can have something pathetically less effective than lifestyle changes or some cognitive therapy sessions, so ask your doctor about Ambien.<p>Same for the cholesterol statins.  They work!  They really do lower serum cholesterol, just as advertised.  However, they have absolutely no affect on mortality rates in the typically prescribed case, and are implicated in serious neurological disease...<p>This kind of nonsense is pervasive in the medical industrial complex.  Doctors, for the most part, dispense treatments pushed on them.  But the stuff is largely a waste of money.<p>With a whole lot of these cancer therapies you statistically buy an extra year of life.  But the person who took the therapies felt like shit for four years and blew all their savings.  The person who just let it be died a year earlier but spent a lot more time feeling ok and saved a lot of money.  You can just go on and on with stuff like this.
