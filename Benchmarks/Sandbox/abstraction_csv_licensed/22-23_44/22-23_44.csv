It integrates with Eclipse, SVN, and Confluence.  Easily customized issue types, permission rules, and workflows mean that it's simple for us to handle development tasks, creative changes, bugs, hardware change tickets, and everything else in a single system.<p>""Oh you're creating a feature request for Client X?  I'll automatically use their special workflow so you get all the right approvals and estimates.""<p>""Oh you're entering a Sev 0 production ticket?  I'll page the right people!""<p>""Oh you want new hardware?  I'll prompt you for all the right fields.""<p>Honestly I could go on and on about how much time and pain Jira has saved us and our clients.<p>Confluence is a really great Wiki.  Most importantly for us it integrates nicely with Jira and Crowd, and let's us manage many independent spaces with group based permissions for access.<p>The wins totally depend on your usage.  If you're 1-2 people, Trac might be fine (although with the new super cheap pricing you should give Jira and Confluence a try).  But in my experiences at a Fortune 500, contracting for several companies, and finally running my own small company, Jira/Crowd/Confluence have been absolutely no-brainers as far as being well worth the purchase price.",1254956316

Some minimal cost/benefit analysis on the assumption would also be good.</i><p>As a corollary to this, try to arrange that any failures will occur as quickly and obviously as possible. For instance: Component X, which is essentially a black box to you, will be a small but critical part of your project. You don't have time to extensively test it, so you make assumptions about its behavior. Ideally, you should start integrating Component X into the full project immediately such that it's heavily used in development and testing environments, so that any violations of your assumptions will show up incidentally to other work.<p>On at least a couple occasions, I've been bitten by assuming that a Component X (which I thought I understood) would do what I expected and thus leaving the final integration until near the end of the project.

Honestly, I am not bragging on anything.\nNow, I agree that Argentinian education is better than Brazilian. Your stats show it and I know it.\nBut put it just like that is simply lying with stats.

Similarly, India has a worse education than Brazil, but produces more knowledge and science simply because it is 5 times bigger.<p>> Argentina had many governments that were not elected by the people<p>I might accept that for a small part of the country's history, the military dictatorship.

The ""solution"" I suggest just <i>allows</i> you to avoid the lowest common denominator - it doesn't make it cheap, or even viable for all devices.

The problem is when this kind of thing gets on the accepted list of ""standard business practices"", and then people stop noticing that it's a bad idea.<p>>  And then they apologized, and you didn't take your key back.<p>True, but keep in mind that, to do that, I would have to return the house.<p>I agree that Amazon has not broken their word on anything.

I am not treating Amazon like a company that is not doing what they said they'll do. Rather I am treating them like a company that sells a seriously inferior product.
