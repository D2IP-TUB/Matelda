But they cannot stop it since WE are remaking it.  I worked pretty much my whole live in the entertainment industry, writing directing, plays, tours you name it I have done it, to a very high level.  In 2007 I released a film and within a day it was on torrents and I was so MAD.  Mad at everyone IRL but the internet.  Why because before I'd released the film I had build the biggest game online at the time to promo the movie <a href=""http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/334475"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/334475</a>.  It was kinda popular.  I'd built a site to support the film which got massive and all I wanted to do but put the film online because I knew it was the biggest way to promote it, it was already happening.  But the investors and the sales company would NOT allow the film to go online for free, they just didn't get how big it could have been.  They spurned the millions of viewer and plays we were getting daily to delay the release by going through the bullshit analogue route taking months to get it onto Amazon.  It is something that taught me a lot.  NOW I am building two start ups to rip a fucking huge hole in Hollywood.  one is going to be a live performance/entertainment site open to anyone anywhere to enjoy live global talent to rise to the top and the other will be a live investment site.

Music celebrity culture is a very important part of every musical genre.<p>So simply providing a large library of great music is not always enough, many people don't actually want to sift through music catalogs to find something they personally like, they want to listen to what their friends listen to so that they can go to the shows together and bond over the music.<p>For example , if you talk to a bunch of teenage metalheads and many will insist that is is the one true genre of music and will not admit to listening to anything else even if they might enjoy it , lest it make them appear outcast from their hurd.<p>This is where the marketing is important , I would imagine that small minority of acts make up a huge percentage of actual music purchased.

Kudos to him and YC being bold enough to come out and say it so bluntly.<p>Here's why I agree with him: I see a lot of comments from people suggesting that Hollywood works on a cycle, where things move along, start to stagnate, and then a dark horse director comes along and creates magic. Altman, Lucas, etc all fit this bill, and they've produced amazing hits. Using money from Hollywood.<p>So, if this cycle is indeed perpetual, and Hollywood simply has to wait for the next big thing, then why don't they? Instead, we are seeing prosecutions on a massive scale, and grossly out of touch legislation proposed like SOPA and PIPA.<p>If Hollywood were so confident, and had so much money, why should they care about these infringers? Is it that copyright infringement makes Hollywood lose that much money, or is it that the economic model has changed dramatically, the execs are scared shitless, and are trying dearly to hold on to their once-empire?<p>I don't think anyone can challenge the assertion that the field has changed dramatically. I also don't think anyone, including the Hollywood execs, has a clue where it's going now. Laws like SOPA seem to be about preventing this change from happening, to keep the power where it was.

In fact, at a professional level you could make the argument that a lack of right-or-wrong answers actually calls for a greater degree of rigor. To quote Heidegger:<p><i>Precisely from the point of view of science, no field takes precedence over the others, neither nature over history nor vice versa. No one method of dealing with objects dominates the others. Mathematical knowledge is no more rigorous than philological-historical knowledge. It merely has the character of ""exactness,"" which is not the same as rigor. To demand exactness of the study of history goes against the specific rigor of the humanities.</i><p>Anyway, anecdotally, four years of shepherding would-be engineers through basic writing requirements was enough for me to conclude that as a group, engineers are singularly terrified by the absence of right-or-wrong answers. For my part, I'm glad to have had a rigorous grounding in the humanities before stumbling into coding.<p>It's like what Eric Raymond says about Lisp: ""Lisp is worth learning for . . . the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it. That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days.""

There is little or no profit in the major label business anymorecertainly not for the artist, and rarely for the label. I believe this is because of the fragmentation of entertainment, failure to embrace new technology, and many other trends. Regardless, this has led to consolidation over a 20 year period, where six major labels became just three (today Sony, Warner, and Universal). And revenue has declined from $15 billion annually at its peak in 1999 to about $6.8 billion today.<p>2. The music industry failed to see the value of the Internet in music distribution. Once piracy became rampant, the music industry essentially signed control of distribution over to its one credible savior, Apple (and now, to an extent, streaming services like Spotify). The net result is that the industry has little control over the price of its product, and little connection to its customer. iTunes dominates.<p>3. Home recording technology is getting better and cheaper, and distribution is easier than ever (recall that Justin Bieber was discovered on YouTube). While this may not have made a meaningful impact yet, it is easy to imagine that it will over the next 10 years. I can already point to several artists, like Brad Sucks (one of my favorites), who are taking advantage of this.<p>In short, I don't think we need to change the status quo much at all.

Oh, and that the mother ""ikke holdt datteren riktig nr hun ammet "" -- didn't hold the daughter right when she breast-fed.<p>The mother did slap the children, but stopped when told it was illegal in Norway.<p>They live in Stavanger but the Stavanger Aftenbladet doesn't have anything about this.<p>One bizarre thing is the complaint that the two children sleep in the same bed as the parents.

But the daughter of Finnish friends of mine was sleeping in the same bed as her parents until at least that age.<p>There is somewhat of an escape clause; immigration law trumps custody for this case and once the mother's permit expires the foster home system would have to apply for a residency permit on behalf of the children if they decide they don't want the children repatriated. But the father, a geophysicist, would have to quit his job of several years in Norway.<p>The foster care system also refused to return the kids to the father, should the parents separate while this is being resolved, and refused to let the children be with the grandparents.<p>This is still hard to believe!",1327141718

I'm just trying to get a feel for how the other side of the table thinks...<p>Now the background behind this question...\nIt has struck me often that the websites of many small or medium sized brick-and-mortar businesses could be improved drastically to bring them more revenue.<p>Now I'm not referring to something subjective like beautifying the front end design - that may or may not improve revenues. \nI'm talking about more concrete functionality behind the scenes - like better and more intelligent search, easier payment integration, customer analytics and so on (my skills are mostly in these areas, though I do have above average front end development skills).<p>As a concrete example, there was a news item recently about a brick-and-mortar book retailer in my city. The owner was ruing that their profits have been dipping because people prefer more convenient online retailers. I went to this brick-and-mortar retailer's site, and saw that their book search capabilities are pathetic. Even the simplest queries gave 0 results, though I know for a fact that they stock this book. In a way, their mediocre website is damaging their own business.<p>It got me thinking, why can't I approach this owner with a well thought out improvement proposal? \nIn fact, why can't I make this my business - finding out less than optimal online business properties, and proactively approach their owners with improvement proposals?<p>I'm rather bored of passively getting work via freelancing sites, after 3 years of doing it.
