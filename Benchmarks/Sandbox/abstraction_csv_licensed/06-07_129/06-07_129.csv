I used the time to make a game in assembly on the school's Model III. There were PC Jrs for a broader computer literacy class, but I never used those.<p>In college, I started as a physics major and hence learned Fortran. Dropped out for a couple of years, went back as a CS major.  Then was exposed to many things; C, C++, Prolog, Ada.  But Pascal was the workhorse of the curriculum.<p>First job out of college was C  (legacy projects) and C++ (new projects).  And Visual Basic for some quick and dirty things.<p>Worked as a programmer for a while.  Stopped.  Did something else for many years. The last year or so I've been retraining myself.  Played with Erlang and Clojure, but nothing serious.  Made a couple of toy Android apps with Java. Wrote some simple Atari 2600 things using an emulator. Working through an idea for a site with Python/Django at the moment.<p>I'd like to work as a programmer again, I think. Or more accurately, I really enjoy being able to build things.<p>I feel most at home in C++ still, but I find myself using Python to try out ideas more and more as time goes on. Assembly still makes me happy, but I don't really use it for anything.",1337754557

But you've demonstrated the reality of the notion itself: ""I have plenty of Politics in my life without it needing every fibre of my life to be infused with it, thank you very much.""<p>The claim is that ""politics"" as a social activity separate from universal, daily human life is artificial and an accident of modern society. That is, in the Marxian ideal you would never <i>think</i> ""politics in my life""that distinction between ""politics"" and ""my life"" would be a meaningless concept, since ""politics"" would be a nonexistent concept. You are already an inherently social being, and politics is just a particular abstraction of that sociality which seems like a good idea in modern society but prevents an ""ideal"" society (for many formulations of ""ideal"").<p>Think about it this way: when you vote, you are acting socially through politics. When you perform a business transaction, you are acting socially through economics. When you go to work (or leisure) with people of different opinions, you are acting socially in a way that we generally just describe as social. All these things are inherently intertwined, but modern society has done a good job making them seem separate and distinct; it has invented terms to distinguish the first two types of social activity, and has imposed rules on them. The third example doesn't have another word because it isn't consciously regulated by societythere is no abstraction for day-to-day interactions with other people. Thus, a Marxian ideal sees no abstraction for any other types of interactions with other people. They all collapsed into one: there is no politics or economics, which are abstractions of sociality.<p>I'm not proposing any particular change in modern society that would bring politics ""into"" your life, merely presenting a way of thinking about politics and sociality that explains why child nutrition (and numerous other social problems) are not also political problems.",1337754528

Amazon would also know this, if I have bought said clubs through them. Google and Amazon almost certainly also know which state I live in (hell Google might know exactly where I am at any given moment if I have an Android phone).<p>So really I don't think Facebook is in an enviable position at all compared to companies like Amazon and Google.<p>""[...] they need to come up with a way to provide a compelling ""We manage your online data for you."" offering that a majority of their users would pay for""<p>What data?

In addition to having special ways of displaying results for different types of searches (local, geo, weather, shopping, etc.), there are also a <i>lot</i> of different heuristics underlying the search results.  It's not just PageRank-and-done, it's many different approaches trying to maintain a uniform level of quality across a variety of niches.<p>I'll repeat that again: it's not the approach that's homogeneous, it's the quality.<p>You can see this with Apple, too.  Their devices aren't limited to some set number of use-cases, it provides an API and ecosystem for creating new, domain-specific applications.  You mention Objective-C in your response, which is kind of missing the point; we're talking about domain-specific applications, not domain-specific languages.  LightTable will presumably be very consistent and general at the API level, and uses Clojure, which is a general-purpose language as well.<p>As for Amazon, their offerings span the entire spectrum from general to domain-specific.  You can get an empty VM, but you can also get something like Elastic MapReduce.  Amazon will happily develop domain-specific products on top of their platform as long as there's a large enough market.<p>Finally, look at Rails, which is a framework specifically for creating web apps.  It doesn't help me write a new NoSQL server, it doesn't help me write a new AAA video game, it seems to be doing okay all the same.  It's used because it's a really effective lever in certain, specific cases.  If we can have a development environment which is a similarly large lever across a wide range of cases, how could that ever be a bad thing?",1337754057

I had the philosophy of designing to survive failure hammered into me, and when I see the Fukishima plants, all the red flags go up in my head.<p>For example, let's assume the wing spar fails. Junior engineer says ""but the spar can't fail! We designed it to handle any predicted load!"". Senior engineer says ""Wrong answer. Anything can fail. How will you design the airplane to survive a wing spar failure?"" (The solution usually is to have dual wing spars.)<p>This question is repeated for every single system and part in the airplane. Failure scenarios are also played out to ensure that failure of one part or system will not have a ""zipper"" effect of breaking other critical systems.<p>With Fukishima, I clearly see ""the sea wall cannot fail, so we won't even bother to investigate if we can make failure of the wall survivable.""<p>As it turned out, it would have been survivable if only the backup generators hadn't failed due to flooding. Hardening those generators (one way) is to simply put them in a concrete box. It's hard to believe that would have been that expensive. Videos of the tsunami showed a lot of masonry structures withstanding it.<p>> How many redundant transmission lines do you need for a generator a mile away?<p>Good question.
