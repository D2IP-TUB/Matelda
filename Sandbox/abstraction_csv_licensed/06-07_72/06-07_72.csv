If you&#x27;re, say, reading music in order to play it, why would you need things like functions and renamings in order to read it? Just read it straight off - one bar at the time. There isn&#x27;t any need to have some kind of &quot;pattern&quot; or &quot;abstraction&quot; that compresses 20 bars into &quot;this one thing, more or less&quot;. And you would have to read all of it to play the piece faithfully anyway. Maybe there is some utility to be able to say &quot;I don&#x27;t care about the nuances; just show me the general structure right now&quot;. I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not a composer.<p>On the other hand, it is of course tremendously useful in programming to look at some lines of code and be able to say &quot;Oh, so this code this and that&quot;, then moving on. If you want more details, dive into that section more. You soar over the code to get an overview and dive down for more specifics when you need to. A music piece can be read (and played) from beginning to end, but that is less useful in programming. Maybe for a late evening with a bottle of wine when you want to appreciate the beauty of a code base that you really like, I guess.",1434092387

This new Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption effectively cut off collection of the new \nservice for FAA 702 and likely 12333 (to some degree) for the Intelligence Community (IC). MS, working with the FBI, developed a surveillance capability to deal with the new SSL. These solutions were successfully tested and went live 12 Dec 2012.<p>March 7, 2014<p>PRISM now collects Microsoft Skydrive data as part of PRISM&#x27;S standard Stored Communications collection package for a tasked FISA Amendments Act Section 702 (FAA702) selector. This means that analysts will no longer have to make a special request to SSO for this - a process step that many analysts may not have known about. This new capability will result in a much more complete and timely collection response from SSO for our Enterprise customers. This success is \nthe result of the FBI working for many months with Microsoft to get this tasking and collection solution established. &quot;SkyDrive is a cloud service that allows users to store and access their files on a variety of devices.<p>March 15, 2013<p>SSO&#x27;s PRISM program began tasking all Microsoft PRISM selectors to Skype because Skype allows users to log in using account identifiers in addition to Skype usernames. Until now, PRISM would not collect any Skype data when a user logged in using anything other than the Skype username which resulted in missing collection; this action will mitigate that. In fact, a user can create a Skype account using any e-mail address with any domain in the world. UTT does not currently allow analysts to task these non-Microsoft e-mail addresses to PRISM, however,",1434090450

Each of us is looking at the other library thinking there&#x27;s too much magic involved. :-)<p>Heh - I think what feels like magic is the syntax that Trine is presuming, which admittedly might seem magical before trying it out. :) The library itself is just a collection of very primitive methods (with the exception of partial()).<p>> Ramda is [considering a technique][1] that would significantly reduce call stacks.<p>That&#x27;s good to hear! But what I&#x27;d really like to see is something that would make the stack trace have a reference to the function definition site, e.g. if I have an error like<p><pre><code>    var getIds = map(prop(&quot;id&quot;));\n    var ids = getIds([{ id: 1 }, null, { id: 2 }]);\n</code></pre>\nthe stack trace would also show the definition site of getIds. This is what I get when I compose functions just using the vanilla JS syntax:<p><pre><code>    function getIds (items) {\n      return items.map(function (item) {\n        return item.id; // the stack trace will point here, and I can also add a breakpoint here without it stopping on every unrelated prop() call\n      });\n    }\n</code></pre>\nLike I mentioned on several occasions here, I&#x27;m hoping for JS to get simpler unbound function syntax, which would work well with Trine, and still have the aforementioned benefits:<p><pre><code>    let getIds = -> this::map(-> this.id);\n</code></pre>\n> Best of luck!<p>Thank you, and likewise! <3",1434089812
