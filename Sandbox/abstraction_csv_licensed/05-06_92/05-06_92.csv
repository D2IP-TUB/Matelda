That means you have backups. And your backups have backups. And your backup's backup's have backups.<p>Is it your fault when bad things happen? If you're good at what you do, probably not - especially when you consider the AMAZING number of things that can go wrong on any given day. However, it IS your fault if the bad things that inevitably happen cause the show to fail because you had no plan B.<p>Maybe it's a disgruntled employee with a set of passwords he really shouldn't have. Or maybe it's an outbreak of anthrax (yeah, I was on a job where that was suddenly an issue). Perhaps you're shooting on a beach and a dead body randomly washes up, suddenly turning your carefully chosen location into a crime scene crawling with cops and coroners (another true story / very rough day.) God forbid it's something really awful, like a bike messenger carrying an important batch of media getting hit by some asshole who was answering his phone instead of paying attention to the road, landing the kid in hospital, and turning your package into collateral damage (horrific moments like this, by the way, make the job seem suddenly unimportant).<p>Regardless, the show must go on. And if you have a good producer, it will. But losing TWO YEARS worth of work because one data center (effectively) went offline? That's seriously embarrassing. Also, very bad for credibility. And yes, reason enough to loose your stripes.",1301637514

Why that's a problem is because it means that the community is different at different times of the day. In order to fix that the simple solution is to only enable publishing in intervals. The problem with that though is that people like new and interesting stuff. By giving a lag to new content it will increase the chances of the user's being bored. So, the next step would be only showing content that interests the user based on what's interested them before, and having that content be constantly updated. That just went from a reputation system to an individualized search engine. It's just a thought though.",1301636887

A good example is the Colgan Air crash from a few years ago.  Anybody knows that when your plane is stalling you're supposed to push the control column forward and apply full engine power.  The plane does the pushing the control column forward part automatically!  But for some reason, the trained airline captain did the exact opposite, stalling the plane and killing everyone on board.  Why?  Because he got paid so little that he couldn't afford a hotel room to sleep in before his work that day, and had to commute across the country and <i>then</i> work a full shift.  This is the airline's fault for impairing someone to the extent that he killed 50+ people by doing the exact opposite of what any trained pilot would do.  $300 for a hotel room and everyone on that flight would still be alive today.<p>Similarly, when you fire someone that works with critical data, you need to make sure the guy's access is revoked.  It's a precaution that needs to be taken, as this case shows.  When necessary precautions are omitted, bad things happen.  Planes crash, and important data goes away forever.)",1301636595

With more people the general consensus on what is good and what is bad becomes so subjective, to the point where it's what the user's that just happen to see it end up defining it as either ""good"" or ""bad"". Instead, the webserver should simply watch the activity levels of all content, including things like whenever a user hovers over a link and for how long to things like replies. And based on all of the available information it should give it a numerical value defining it's influence on the community. It probably can't be 100% accurate, but it can be pretty close and most likely better than what is in place in most communities.",1301635212
