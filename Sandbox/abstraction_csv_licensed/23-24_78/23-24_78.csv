Code re-use and recycling inside technical companies is very common. If any code you wrote there turned out to be great/good at something you&#x27;d never know where it might end up. Perhaps in the processor of some killer robot in the future.<p>I wonder where the code that is running inside the drones today comes from. Some one who never meant to be involved in those things must have written either the compiler, specs or actual code that these things use to do their killing, I can&#x27;t imagine any company (no matter how secure they might want to be) designing a completely new processor architecture and tools and compilers and all that from scratch.",1419206218

8781383,comment,8780813,8780813,0,0,programminggeek,,,"I am guessing the reason they aren&#x27;t putting ads on Quora yet it would limit their ability to raise money. Uncertainty drives the theoretical value higher because while the average CPM on ads might be say $10, they can project because of their higher quality content that they will be able to charge $25 or $50 CPM or something like that. So, they can sell projections and vanity metrics instead of actual revenue to investors.<p>Also, not having ads means they are totally product focused, not focused on ad sales and driving up their ad rates. That helps them keep their team small so they don&#x27;t burn through money hiring to build up and sell their own advertising system.<p>Last, not putting ads on their site insulates them from the ups and downs of the advertising market. If ad prices drop one quarter, their future projections have to change a lot because of the real numbers.<p>Long story short, I don&#x27;t think if Quora put AdSense on their site that they would have been able to raise $161 million dollars.",1419205925

8781374,comment,8781245,8781245,0,0,ggreer,,,"I&#x27;m the author of ag[1]. File searching stuff interests me, so I took a look at grab. Sadly, grab only compiles on Linux right now. Some of the mmap flags and cpu_set_t aren&#x27;t defined on OS X. I was curious about the performance claims, so I benchmarked grab and ag on my code directory. Times are medians of five runs. I used a Lenovo X140e running Ubuntu 14.10. It has a 160GB Intel SSD, 8GB of RAM, and an AMD A4-5000 (4 x 1.5Ghz Jaguar).<p><pre><code>    ggreer@boron:~/code% du -sh .\n    8.3G	.\n\n    ggreer@boron:~/code% time ag cpu_set_t\n    ag cpu_set_t  4.45s user 5.25s system 295% cpu 3.285 total\n\n    ggreer@boron:~/code% time grab -R cpu_set_t .\n    grab -R cpu_set_t .  13.31s user 21.67s system 35% cpu 1:38.28 total\n\n</code></pre>\n30x faster, but these benchmarks aren&#x27;t a fair fight. Ag ignores binary and hidden files by default. If I tell ag to do an unrestricted search, it&#x27;s still 2x faster (43 seconds vs 98 seconds). Even with cold caches (echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches between each run), ag beats grab handily:<p><pre><code>    ag -u cpu_set_t  19.62s user 32.56s system 90% cpu 57.433 total\n\n    grab -R cpu_set_t .  15.48s user 37.89s system 37% cpu 2:22.67 total\n</code></pre>\nI haven&#x27;t profiled grab yet, but there&#x27;s definitely some low-hanging fruit. For example, it looks like grab could get a big speedup by detecting literal patterns and using strstr() instead of a whole PCRE engine. Also, FileGrep::find is calling pthread_mutex_lock/unlock even if there are no matches to print. Adding a condition around that makes grab 1.5x faster.<p>I&#x27;m glad I took a look at grab. Despite its shortcomings, I learned from it. I&#x27;ll definitely try out a few tricks grab uses that ag doesn&#x27;t, such as thread affinity.<p>One more thing: The author of grab is right about counting newlines. It does hurt performance. Still, I enable it by default in ag. I think the tradeoff is worthwhile.<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher</a><p>Edit: The mutex locking change was so straightforward that I submitted a PR: <a href=""https://github.com/stealth/grab/pull/2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/stealth/grab/pull/2</a>",1419205401

8781368,comment,8780820,8781287,0,0,cesarb,,,"I&#x27;m trying to understand that too.<p>A Linux server (I&#x27;m guessing for no particular reason it&#x27;s a Linux server) would have no reason to automount a USB stick, and its console would be at a login screen (so a HID device would gain nothing).<p>So my guess for the intrusion scenario would be a &quot;cold boot&quot; attack: plug a specially prepared USB stick, open the server case, short the reset pins in the motherboard (AFAIK, modern motherboards still have the pins for the reset button, even though modern cases don&#x27;t have a reset button anymore), and tell the BIOS to boot from the USB stick. The USB stick then dumps the memory, which still has data from the previously running system (since it was an unclean shutdown), with some luck including cryptographic keys.<p>That scenario would also explain why he briefly saw the server back on the KVM: they might have been using the KVM to interact with the BIOS.<p>The defense against such a scenario would be to aggressively shut down all processes and kexec to a memory-wiping kernel as soon as any unexpected device (not only USB, but also PCI and others) is seen, or if the case is opened. Also make it send an alert message through the network with the details whenever it&#x27;s triggered, to be able to diagnose why the server shut down without warning.<p>But there&#x27;s another possible scenario: the &quot;bureaucratic confusion&quot; scenario. It&#x27;s possible that the systems at his hosting location got confused, and thought he was no longer a client. The apparent intrusion would be a techie repurposing the servers for another client.",1419205205

This study is limited to particulate matter pollution, not greenhouse gas emissions. Most readers nowadays associate &quot;environmental impact&quot; with climate change, so it&#x27;s deceptive of the publisher to not specify that electric vehicles cause less greenhouse gas emissions overall than petroleum vehicles.<p>2. The particulate matter pollution in this study is a solvable problem, even if you keep the coal plants. Equipment like bag houses and static precipitators are already installed on a lot of coal generators to remove particulate.<p>3. We are currently in peak coal.
