Google controls the way people surf the web, as a monopolist they will be hit with regulation like this more frequently. The homepage of those newspapers used to be the main avenue to get to the content rather than search.<p>Please note that I'm against such legislation, I just feel that Google is operating on a principle of asymmetry and uses its monopoly position to control an ever larger amount of the content on the web and access to that content without wanting to reciprocate by releasing their own content in a similar manner.

If they would not like to appear in the google search, a single entry in the robots.txt would take care of that. However, since google does send them a lot of traffic, publishers actually want to appear as far up in the listing as possible and spend ridiculous amounts of money on SEO. However, now that newspaper publishers have problems monetizing, they turn to the state, point to google and cry ""they are making money with our content, we want a share."" while forgetting that google provides a service of its own: Google does compile and serve the index, and for that, they take money. They do not serve newspaper pages to the reader or create content.<p>I have no special feelings for google, but making a law that requires search engine providers to strike a separate contract with any publishing entity whose contents they want to list would hardly be beneficial to any side.

The decryption of the files was not the only thing that worked against Sendero Luminoso, but it must have hurt them.",1354017648
