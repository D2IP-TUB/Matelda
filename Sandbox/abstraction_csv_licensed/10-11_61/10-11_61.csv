There is a huge difference in the level of teaching at compulsory schools and universities in Finland.<p>""People are not much interested in learning in schools"" is a gross overstatement and generalization. There are those who are very motivated, those who are not motivated at all and the majority who fall somewhere in between. I saw firsthand how even the least motivated students were engaged by one really good biology teacher. Everyone was interested when the teacher did his job well. On the other hand, with terrible teachers even the best students tended to zone out. I imagine this is the same everywhere in the world.<p>As for the needs of individual pupils, I couldn't agree more.  When I first entered school I already knew how to read and add numbers together. I was not allowed to progress at my own pace, and subsequently got really, really bored twiddling my thumbs during those first few years.<p>I think this catering to the lowest common denominator and lack of individual care is something that the Finnish school system really suffers from. Sadly with all these articles out many observers seem to think the Finnish school system is infallible, and they're only aiming at replicating the success of Finnish schools instead of thinking how to do even better.",1318762255

You can determine that from the .se at the end of the domain, the lookup of the domain name which gives you an IP address attached to a router in Stockholm.<p>Sweden is a fairly large country but not nearly as large as the continental US, so in flight time of packets on a single wire is going to be limited to ~half the cross section of Sweden, say 500 km or so rather than the thousands of kilometers from your example. Broadband is extremely common in Europe with Sweden as <i>the</i> leading country wrt to broadband penetration.<p>If he was testing from a location very far away from his local server I would assume (yes, that's a risk but I'll take it) that he would have mentioned that in the article.<p>The default is that people that are from Sweden and that host their machines in Sweden are themselves currently in Sweden.<p>If he is on a very slow link (which is always possible) then he should have mentioned this in the article, and he probably should have done a traceroute -n to rule out that he's not using a congested hop somewhere along the way.<p>The virtual server is most likely the culprit, that's why I said 'the result is not as hot as it seems'. My guess is that there is some underlying artifact here but there is not enough info in the article to figure out what that is. A real analysis would require much more information.<p>I ran the same tests in the article (minus the virtual severs) on two links that I control and saw a very minimal improvement, another reason to write 'not as hot as it seems'.<p>You can repeat all of this in a couple of minutes.<p>So, in closing: if you are going to make blanket statements about TCP performance you should either give all the particulars <i>or</i> I will assume reasonable defaults in trying to repeat your experiment.<p>Both the title here and the article suggest that this is some sort of silver bullet and it definitely isn't, the specifics of the situation are what makes it work for him, there is 0 guarantee that doing the same will improve your situation, and I can think of some circumstances where it will make things worse.<p>'The speed of light would like a word with you' was plenty snide in its own right and that's why I responded the way I did, apologies for that but you made a huge assumption yourself by extrapolating to a situation that you are possibly familiar with rather than researching the most likely situation the author of the article was in, which to me seemed to be the way to approach the problem and verify the result.<p>Of course I'd be interested in a magic one line tweak that will improve all my short lived connections but this isn't it, or if it is then it will need a lot more documentation on how this can be used productively on random connections rather than the way it is used here, to optimize for a single link.<p>Better like that?<p>By the way, the google article linked below gives a much more in-depth argument for increasing the window size and <i>also</i> gives you a good idea on the limits of its effectiveness:<p><a href=""http://research.google.com/pubs/archive/36640.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.google.com/pubs/archive/36640.pdf</a><p>previous HN coverage:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1942442"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1942442</a><p>And several others that I can't seem to locate.",1318761392

I can show you how it works, on a basic level: See, it goes around like this. This connects here. That switch opens. This moves back, and that's the behavior that we're looking for. Easy.<p>Why is it that when that same thing happens a hundred times a second, the emergent behavior suddenly becomes mind-boggling? It's just the same thing, <i>faster</i>. You already understand it. Your brain cant work fast enough to see what's going on, but thats exactly why we built the machines: to translate very fast things into things slow enough to understand. The complexity of the speed is illusory.<p>It strikes me as like a small child, watching the cars go by-- Zoom! Zoom! Surely that is the most amazing thing that exists. But when she grows up, she learns that <i>everything</i> has a velocity, which has to be <i>some</i> number, so it might as well be high. The interesting things are still interesting, moreso even, when it's going very slow. Just going fast is kind of boring.<p>What's cool are the things that emerge when you abstract. You have a car, and you know why that works. The connection between gasoline and forward motion is straightforward enough. But as soon as you have three cars on a road, you have <i>traffic</i>, and that's something fundamentally new. And you can analyze the traffic, figure out how it works-- but can you see how traffic is fundamentally dependent on the behavior of gasoline? And \ngasoline on the behavior of a refinery?<p>And what happens when the refinery is run by people who drive to work? Now you have a recursive system. Can you still understand it? Maybe today. By tomorrow it will have changed itself. Can you understand the change?<p>What happens when you think you understand the change, so you make a prediction, but your prediction affects what happens, making you wrong? But you take this into account when you make your prediction, becoming right again, except now you're a part of the recursive system, and there will <i>never</i> be a right answer. Understanding has become <i>impossible</i>.<p>Now <i>that's</i> baffling.<p>(And not to get all political, but this is also why a properly functioning government is not merely a hard, but an intractable problem. No matter how much you know what you're doing, you can't control something that controls you... But that doesn't stop us from trying.)",1318760580

Then you can just `git push username@server.com:myrepo.git`.<p>This of course doesn't give you a web UI for creating repositories. And everyone with access to `username` on the server can access all the repositories.",1318759393

Every step you take is heavier, you can't move around as nimbly, public transportation is more uncomfortable, you sweat more, clothes don't fit well, etc, etc. I know this for a fact because I've previously gone from 240lbs to 180ish, and it's just amazing what difference it makes, especially when you're also fit.<p>Also, 20 years of life is <i>a lot</i>. You may not think that you want to live that long, but having seen my dad retire at 60ish, being still fit, healthy and active, and continuing so for the last 15 years, and continuing for the foreseeable future, it changes one's perception of what old people are capable of today, especially when they're healthy.",1318759380

The 3D printing connection, the totally original idea, interesting use of embedded accelerometer... really, this is the kind of thing where I go, 'wow, why didn't I think of that'. Super stuff, and inspiring too.<p>I'd be a little wary of throwing it up high on the edge of that canyon!<p>Some years ago I made a 'poor mans' version of this using 6 webcams connected to a laptop via USB mounted to the roof of my car, it was a fun little project but the speed of the car combined with the delay caused by the various connections caused images that were less than impressive (lots of stitching errors).<p>This was before google streetview launched and when I saw their gear I realized I'd been going about it on a much too cheap path. The idea was to allow you to set up a road trip and to visualize the whole thing as the driver so you could get a feel of the trip from home, or to allow you to travel in a completely virtual way.",1318759290

Upgrade Complete (I and II), Elephant Quest, This Is The Only Level (I and II), Achievement Unlocked (I and II).<p>The really amusing bit to me is that not only are they bald-facedly mocking this addiction-oriented gameplay, they are simultaneously self-referentially some of the most fun games in that genre.",1318759218
