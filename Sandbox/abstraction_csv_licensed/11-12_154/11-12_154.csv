Their principles may be different from your own, possibly even evil.<p>I do think standing for principles that are for the good of humanity is something worth doing as an individual, regardless of the technological abstraction you work on.

It seems to me that for truly free speech, restrictive licenses need to be abandoned, even if it&#x27;s at the sake of a content donor&#x27;s money (traditional copyright) or fame (copyright and copyleft). There are a lot of good arguments for the copyfree movement, in general. If we see freedom as being the absence of limitations, licenses like the WTFPL can really be considered the most free, and general arguments for free software can be applied appropriately.<p>And, as we&#x27;ve seen with the advent of unauthorized content distribution networks, people will treat work of merit as if it&#x27;s licensed WTFPL anyway, whether the author/s like/s it or not. Rejecting confusing license terms makes it easier for projects to thrive in the open source community as well. It really confounds me how RMS can reject DRM but be so supportive of his own freedom-limiting psychological DRM of sorts.<p>Here&#x27;s a list -- <a href=""http://copyfree.org/licenses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://copyfree.org/licenses/</a> -- of these sorts of licenses, and a good, slightly more serious introduction to the public domain/copyfree/WTFPL movement in general, for those interested.",1395661863

But since the trend nowadays is to generate CSS from a bunch of LESS or SASS files, minify the whole thing, and stuff it into a single HTTP request, it&#x27;s not impossible for large and complicated apps to end up with over 4K selectors. When you&#x27;re living in SASS fairyland you don&#x27;t always remember that your beautifully nested rules and mixins will compile into dozens of CSS selectors.",1395661718

7457656,comment,7456585,7457476,23,0,tfinniga,,,"To answer the questions, at least in our particular case:<p>- Do paying customers ever install a hacked version?<p>Yes, this happened fairly often.. less than 1% of the time, but still often enough for us to take it into consideration.<p>There were some silly suggestions about what to do when we detected it was a cracked version.  If there is _any_ chance that it would occur on a paying customer&#x27;s computer, you can dismiss the silly suggestions pretty quickly.  In the end we decided to just save out files which were unreadable by end users, but that we could recover the data from.  Our customers had to contact us, and then we could recover the data and sort out their licensing issues at the same time.  We didn&#x27;t have any issue with them using a crack to get their job done, we just wanted to make sure their experience was good.. sometimes the cracks broke functionality.<p>Non-paying users could become customers and get their data, but this didn&#x27;t really happen very often.. it was enjoyable to read their reactions on the warez forums though.<p>- Do people who start with the hacked version ever pay?<p>Um, not really, as far as I could tell.  IIRC it was 1 or 2 out of tens of thousands.<p>You have to be careful not to spend too much time on this stuff.. if you aren&#x27;t converting cracked users to paid users, then the time is better spent just improving the product.<p>- Into what languages should I translate my software?<p>In our case it was Italian, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, German, and French.  We had a lot of Russian and Chinese users, but almost none of them paid, so it&#x27;s not worth paying for the translation.<p>- How long does it take a demo user to convert to paid<p>We switched from a time-limited demo (30 days) to a usage-limited demo (25 saves).  After using up your saves you could still use the product to learn it, but just not save or export your work, and if you needed a time-limited demo or any other kind of trial extension we would provide that for the asking.  We did this because we thought that our target users were very busy, and giving them one shot to try out the product over 30 days was unreasonable.. it was more reasonable that they would have a few hours here and there to learn it and evaluate it.<p>Anyhow, the data on conversion time did bear out the decision.. we had users who converted from demo to paid the same day, after 1 week, after 6 months, etc.<p>---<p>In general, our approach was to encourage people to pay if they&#x27;re the type of people that pay for software, and not worry too much about people that don&#x27;t pay for software.<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have the actual heatmap of legit / cracked users.  I do have a copy of the country by country breakdown, but I&#x27;m not sure what date range it was for.<p>I do remember that the cracks would come out only a few hours after we released our software.<p>For these numbers, legit was a combination of currently in demo, and fully paid.  Anything else was a cracked version.  From most total users to least, here are the top few.<p>US: 78% legit<p>China: 17% legit<p>Korea: 37% legit<p>Italy: 64% legit<p>UK: 75% legit<p>Russian Federation: 18% legit<p>Germany: 61% legit<p>Japan: 80% legit<p>Spain: 71% legit<p>Turkey: 22% legit<p>Sweden: 83% legit<p>Taiwan: 37% legit<p>Ukraine: 27% legit<p>Poland: 73% legit<p>France: 64% legit<p>Czech Republic: 51% legit<p>Hong Kong: 17% legit<p>Canada: 78% legit<p>Most of this isn&#x27;t too unexpected.

The entire thing, covers and all, were printed on normal paper. It was (barely) held together by a plastic spiral ring.<p>I get in the first class, lab manual in front of me. The teacher comes in and... wait... Is that... That&#x27;s their name... on my manual. Ugh, I see how it is, whatever. &quot;Don&#x27;t forget your manuals by the first class - they are MANDATORY&quot;.<p>Then comes our first lab - the first thing she tells us? &quot;Oh, your manual is old, so a lot of those directions aren&#x27;t right. I&#x27;ll tell you what&#x27;s changed when need be (every class).&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re going to charge us $50 for a shitty lab manual, can you please make sure it at least keeps itself together and has the right freaking instructions!",1395658835
