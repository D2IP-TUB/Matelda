Besides the fact that I hate the language I love the thing it does: abstraction. In the backend I only have to care about the information I want to provide and for the frontent I can do whatever I want to do with this information. My largest problems are the verbosity of the language and the incomplete implementations (also xpath). Btw. I think the Excel formulas are much closer to a functional language than XSLT should ever be ;-)",1333875540

3813449,comment,3805302,3809602,1,0,el_muchacho,,,"The drop after 2007/2008 probably corresponds to the Phobos/Tango debacle, and the fact that Walter decided to fork with D2.<p>One of the main problems was, he was almost the sole compiler developer, and could hardly keep up with the tasks of maintaining 2 parallel branches and developing new ideas at the same time. People complained that they couldn't get involved as much as they wanted. It's understandable that many people thought that D didn't have a solid future with such uncertainties.<p>Nowadays, these problems are mostly overcome with a much better organization: there are several committers for the compiler, and several committers for the standard library. Phobos is the standard library, it's maturing, D2 has shown its strengths over D1 and the community is united again, because not only it is deeply involved with the design of the language and standard lib(through the m-l), it is also involved with the implementation of essential parts of it. 2011 has been a very good year for D, and I think that more than ever, the whole project feels like it's going in the right direction.<p>edit: I guess another reason D isn't gaining as much traction as it could is, it has been removed from the Alioth computer language shootout. For a language which is aimed at raw speed (and was brilliant at that when it was still on the shootout), it's a severe blow.",1333875461

3813444,comment,3812907,3813291,7,0,Animus7,,,"> The decrease in productivity with node comes from having to write everything with callbacks. Programming asynchronously is crazy, it makes very simple algorithms very annoying to write.<p>I know <i>exactly</i> what you mean, because that's what I thought a year ago. I was going on and on about this to everyone. Mea culpa.<p>Then I actually <i>tried</i> node and learned the functional side of JavaScript (I don't mean the semantics, which are very simple; I mean powerful LISPish design patterns). Now I don't think about callbacks anymore, because I have a functional toolkit that mostly hides them.<p>You say asynchronous coding makes simple algorithms annoying to write. So let's have an example. Read two files -- in parallel -- trap I/O errors and warn about them, otherwise merge and sort the files by line, write the result to a third file, and warn about I/O errors there as well. Simple enough?<p>My solution is 8 lines, formatted. It was very pleasant to write.<p><pre><code>  fork(\n    ['lines.txt', 'lines2.txt'].map(function(name) {\n      return fs.readFile.bind(fs, name);\n    }),\n    check(console.warn.bind(console), function(a) {\n      fs.writeFile('linesOut.txt', a.sum().split('\n').sort().join('\n'), check(console.warn.bind(console)));\n    })\n  )\n</code></pre>\nIf you've seen enough JS to deduce what the lib definitions for fork() and check() might be, then this code will seem obvious -- almost trivial. Otherwise, you will probably claim shenanigans or 'spaghetti' because it doesn't look like <i>insert favorite programming language/framework here</i>.<p>So it saddens me to hear people whining about this aspect of node -- partly because it recalls my own naivety, and partly because I know from experience that they're missing out on something great.",1333875265

It's the same reason nobody goes to a physical bank anymore (except old people): it costs a lot to do anything over the counter, be it withdrawing cash, paying bills, or... cashing checks :) You can do that free over internet. Usage of cash is going down as well but I think cash is fundamental enough that it will never disappear, though.<p>Wire transfers are free here and can be initiated thru internet banking and be completed the following banking day. Before internet, we had wire transfer machines, similar to ATMs. Debit cards don't cost anything either (some banks charge a yearly fee, similarly to some credit cards). It would probably cost tens of euros to cash a check here, and rightly so given the amount of labour.<p>Wire transfers are good. You can even buy from internet shops without a credit/debit card if they support a scheme where you make a verified wire transfer through your bank's internet service, and many shops do. The shops get online verification from my internet bank that the wire transfer has been made, so the payment is completed immediately and the shops just ship you the good.",1333874176

You're saying that using a term on a man doesn't change the fact that it's a term used to degrade women? Sure, that's true. But if it is being applied to men, it is also a term to degrade men, at which point it is hardly gendered.<p>You might be a little more right if we were talking about a word that is <i>inherently</i> related to women and only women, but both women and men may be considered whores in the original meaning of the word.",1333872417

Also, the CPU is so simple that everything around it (the spec, various emulators, assemblers and compilers) is quite accessible even to people who have little experience with this low-level stuff. In short, if the DCPU-16 and related technology do not fit the ""fun hacking"" label, then I don't know what does.",1333872225

We have been playing around with various methods to drive and keep traffic to our blog (wordpress). This includes typical social media and a small experiment with Adwords. Traffic has remained low (zero).<p>Recently we posted a link in this forum and received a large spike in traffic (thanks!). However no one visited any other part of the blog and traffic has dropped off. We are aware this its a common problem. How can it be solved? Why did it happen?<p>Our own assumptions are that 1 content did not excite, 2 user behaviour (not likely to go past linked page).<p>How have you built up a following?How did your break through moment happen?",1333872147
