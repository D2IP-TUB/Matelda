Even so, I read most WSJ stories because I find them linked from Google News where I have lots of special news-search sections defined.

If Murdoch's WSJ disappears from Google News, it will disappear from my world and very likely I'd just end my subscription.

That's basically what this is:<p>Favorites - Click a button on a tweet and it goes into a list of tweets on your account<p>Retweet - Click a button on a tweet and it goes into a list of tweets on your account AND it shows up on your followers' timelines AND you get stats about how many other people retweeted it AND you get notified when your tweets are retweeted AND you can view just the retweets of your friends.<p>Retweets, as Twitter has implemented them, are just favorites upgraded. I think a lot of the controversy would go away if they hadn't co-opted a term from their users and ended up using it in a very different way than it had been defined.<p>An idea to avoid the commenting controversy: Allow an @reply following a retweet to show in your followers' timelines, even if they don't follow that user. Since Twitter won't show you @replies by your friends to users you don't follow yourself, that would be a good way to expose those discussions in a relevant way. UI-wise, there could be a small ""comments"" box that opens up when retweeting that just posts this @reply as a status update. Best of all, no API changes or backwards compatibility hacks.",1257956001

Yup, SciPy is this, kinda, though not to the same extent as APL.<p>2. A language with an extremely strange syntax, apparently engineered for terseness on the smallest possible scale. Nope, SciPy is basically just a bunch of Python libraries, and the language syntax is still Python's.<p>(There's more to SciPy than the matrix operations, but that's what the original poster was mostly talking about and what might prompt comparisons with APL.)",1257955848
