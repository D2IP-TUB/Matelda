About 3:30 when they&#x27;re reading from the AA book -- &quot;I admit that I am powerless over alcohol&quot; as Teller makes fun like it&#x27;s the stupidest idea ever. A lot of the people you&#x27;ll find in AA really do need to admit they&#x27;re powerless over alcohol. That&#x27;s no joke.<p>But Penn and Teller readily admit they&#x27;ve never had a drink in their lives (it was a choice we made, a path we never decided to go down, so screw you losers that aren&#x27;t total teetotalling illusionists).<p>The comments here in general demonstrate a general lack of understanding of addiction. It&#x27;s not a choice, it&#x27;s a disease, and the prognosis is generally shitty. I&#x27;m not saying AA is the end all be all (it&#x27;s not), but holy shit, don&#x27;t be so dismissive of an organization that saves lives by trying to give people strategies they can use to avoid drinking. I&#x27;ll put it this way -- if alcohol (or any recreational substance) is fucking up your life, I don&#x27;t see any harm in seeking out a support group of people who have dealt with similar issues and have gone on to lead normal lives. There&#x27;s a lot of suffering people out there that refuse to take that first step because they believe bullshit like it&#x27;s something they can fix themselves <i>with magic</i>.<p>And for all the people bitching about how AA is religious -- it&#x27;s not! The &quot;higher power&quot; thing is more of a philosophy than a religion. This philosophy essentially says alcoholism is a disease, individuals are generally powerless to control it (as evidenced by the lack of an addicts ability to control it in the past), and they will need the help of some kind of &quot;higher power&quot; to avoid drinking. What&#x27;s the nature of this higher power? That&#x27;s for you to decide. It could simply be AA as an organization, a higher power that will help with support to prevent you from drinking.  I dunno, there&#x27;s a few books about it, but my point is -- it&#x27;s not religious!",1395997146

7485993,comment,7480273,7483189,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"And the conservative/libertarian argument fails, as Adam Smith notes in <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, because:<p>• The fully-realized cost of labor is that which allows it to survive <i>and support its family, and educate its progeny</i>.  A business which cannot afford to pay a living wage is effectively demanding a societal subsidy.  While there are circumstances in which that social welfare might be reasonably extended, it seems to me that it&#x27;s a decision which should be made deliberately, and that companies which show recurring high levels of profit while being unwilling to pay a living wage are prima facie proof of a market failure.<p>• The inherent negotiating advantage of employers means that it will virtually always prevail in wage negotiations with labor.<p>• There&#x27;s a common misperception that people are paid what they&#x27;re worth to a company.  This isn&#x27;t the case.  Rather:  in a well-functioning and competitive market, your wage will <i>always</i> be <i>less</i> than you&#x27;re worth.  Much as a manufacturer&#x27;s printer PPM rating is best interpreted as &quot;performance never to be exceeded&quot;, your true worth to a company always sets an absolute ceiling on what your pay will be.  Exceptions exist where markets are not well-functioning:  e.g., in the case of excecutive pay, where there&#x27;s a strong level of capture between execs and payment committees, and in which pay serves not only a compensation but a market signalling role as to the health and robustness of the firm (it&#x27;s effectively a social signaling Veblen good).<p>For all of these reasons, defining a minimum wage at roughly the level of a living wage is strongly congruent with Adam Smith&#x27;s principles.

There was one in particular which I read all the copy for in sickly fascination. I couldn&#x27;t find it again, but if I do I will post it to this thread.<p>They often have a ticker of out-of-date arbitrage opportunities, to demonstrate their capabilities. Your trial is superior to this in one way, and inferior in another (which is key.) You offer real moneymaking opportunities, proving the value. But potential clients, as you&#x27;re well aware, do not yet trust you. And running your code requires trust. I think you should take a leaf from the con men&#x27;s book, and show out-of-date opportunities on your site.<p>The scammers give an explanation of what arbitrage is, and what &quot;separates&quot; their system from a get-rich-quick scheme. They invoke images of fast cars and big houses. They are, of course, exaggerating to prey on the naive and desperate, but the principle holds for a real product. The wikipedia page you link to is sterile. If it were me, I&#x27;d write an explanation which dealt directly with gigahashes, and which sought to excite your customers and inspire them to imagine their pile of BTC growing every six seconds.<p>These next thoughts are more my own. If your software is any good, people are going to reverse engineer it; why not post the mathematics behind your system on your site? If people can see the basis behind your program, they&#x27;ve a reason to trust it. Even if they don&#x27;t understand the principles, they&#x27;ll be reassured to see that there are indeed principles. I&#x27;d put up all the personal details you&#x27;re comfortable sharing. If people can read a bio blurb and see your face, and feel you&#x27;ve made yourself vulnerable, they&#x27;re much more apt to make themselves vulnerable to you. (Of course, if you put up too much information the vulnerability ceases to be metaphorical.)<p>Additionally, while I understand you can&#x27;t compromise your competitive advantage, I&#x27;m curious to learn more about your system. Is six seconds an arbitrary number, or did you arrive there empirically? Are you running the tool yourself? How much have you made?
