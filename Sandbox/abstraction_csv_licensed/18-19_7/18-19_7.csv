217636,comment,217486,217486,0,0,sealedidentity,,,"Sorry but I got to completely disagree with Arrington's analysis. Yahoo is a media portal and they do graphic ads in search pretty well too. Where Yahoo went bust was in trying to usurp Google's lead in search. That is the only area where they are #2. Yahoo still is the #1 media portal on the web and the following they have is very loyal.<p>If Yahoo had taken MS's deal it would've struck at the very heart where the competencies lie.\nThey would've had to give up on their Panama system which is being tweaked and is currently showing better prospects.\n$1B for putting paid to all Yahoo research and their tech is an insult to Yahoo techies.\nMS just provided an opportunity to increase the current operating income and cash flow but in all other quarters straitjacketed Yahoo.\nYahoo would be forced to stop managing and hiring search engineers and just display ads. It is an industry fact that MS's per query revenue projected is lower than Yahoo's current revenue.<p>What Microsoft was asking Yahoo to do was too risky. They have a history of screwing up internet deals and straitjacketing Yahoo's core competencies in exchange for cash is too much to ask.<p>I will agree Jerry mismanaged Yahoo a bit much, but running a $2B company isn't a joke.<p>I believe Yahoo was right in rejecting MS's deal. They needed Yahoo more than it needed them.<p>And Icahn isn't an angel. He is just itching for a fight to make a few hundred millions.<p>Focusing on the Google alliance gives Yahoo enough leeway to get marginally additional revenue while concentrating on their media and Panama divisions.<p>The stock might be down now, but the market is quite open for experimentation. And if they get it right, who knows, the stock will perhaps shoot up like before.",1213469602

217632,comment,217467,217467,0,0,rubymaverick,,,"I have read ""That's not what I meant!"" a couple times in college, it was actually part of the reading for a required course.  It was an extremely eye opening experience for me, and would highly suggest anyone out there read it before you waste time feeling frustrated with the opposite sex because of inherit linguistic differences.  Good article Giles, I completely agree the lack of female programmers to be a HUGE problem.  I have the privilege to work with some female programmers and they are great programmers, and bring a dynamic to the team that just wouldn't be there without them.  Diversity is a necessary part of any good organization.",1213469132

217620,comment,217411,217439,0,0,tx,,,"You don't hate ASP.NET, you seem to hate WebForms and for very good reasons. You don't have to use WebForms though, there are other toolkits available. In fact, I built a neat desktop application using ASP.NET stack once - you can embed it into any .NET process to neatly handle HTTP requests.<p>One huge advantage of ASP.NET is that it is crazy fast. After a while it generates native-code assemblies and you're basically looking at C/C++ speed when handling requests.<p>You can get yourself one of those newer (and cheap) dual-CPU quad-core servers with 8GB of RAM and this machine will handle some serious load (enough for most applications). This will allow you not to mess with distributed stuff and keep your stuff in RAM in between requests. Such setup will be an equivalent of a farm of RoR machines with MUCH smaller load on  DB layer.<p>Of course, it doesn't apply to high-traffic projects like  Twitter/Facebook, etc.",1213468211

It's good because all the thousands of people Americans are basically torturing overseas have one less journalist giving the politicians responsible cover.<p>It's good because the politicians like Cheney no longer can obscure shit like this <a href=""http://www.antiwar.com/news/?articleid=2444"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antiwar.com/news/?articleid=2444</a> by gaining respectability on his show.  Which means that Americans will be slightly less likely to allow this outrageous abuse and torture to continue.<p>Yeah.  I'm glad Tim Russerts dead.  I was elated all day.  Why?  Because I think torturing people is wrong and I think Tim Russert helped people who directly ordered that torture deceive the American people.  I think he helped deceive america intentionally (I do not think he knew about the torture, though).  To me, the thought that there is one less gasbag fooling my fellow americans into thinking goons like Cheney who order systematic torture are on the up and up is a great thing.<p>I guess this makes me the one with the despicable attitude and questionable moral fabric.  Go look at those pictures.  Tim Russert helped the politicians who ordered that to happen.  Now that he's dead, he can't do that.  Yeah, I'm glad he's dead.<p>Condolences to his family, though.<p>And I saw the disgusting spectacle of people who's shock at being confronted with death made then lionize this person who was quite flawed everywhere.

I think that it does a very good job of displaying content, and it does it much faster than PDFs.<p>At the same time, there're a few disadvantages: for instance, I can't fill out a form using iPaper.<p>I think the three big things about iPaper that make it not-so-easily-adaptable ATM are as follows: first, you need to use Scribd to use iPaper, so it adds a layer of complexity; second, it doesn't integrate well into a web site's layout, so text has an advantage over it in terms of styling; third, and most importantly, when you embed iPaper it's impossible to read unless you click for a full view.<p>That being said, I've been watching Scribd for exactly this reason. Hopefully, they have ideas for expanding it further and making it into an acceptable web format, for the sake of all of us logorrheics in the world.",1213468113

Sometimes he was in attack mode, sometimes he would switch to kid-gloves mode (I remember him giving a particularly easy interview to Mike Huckabee on the eve of the Iowa primary, and that is a man with a LOT of ""interesting"" issues to talk about). Maybe he was special in the world of journalists because he actually had an attack mode. But let him be praised for what he was, and not an idealized vision of what he never was.",1213467393

Which is why Dick Cheney preferred to go on his show because of the message control.  And why he allowed people to put things off the record after interviews.  Let's not pretend he represented journalism or that the times he did call people on things, it wasn't just picking on sacrificial lambs so he could maintain a thin veneer of responsibility behind which he could hide the powerful people he ultimately protected.  He was fair to everyone except the american people.  He's dead now.  He hurt America.  Millions of people die every day.  I can't believe there aren't hundreds of thousands of them more worth this outpouring of grief.<p>My condolences to his family, and to the powerful elites who depended on his show to control the way they distributed propaganda to the masses.",1213466996
