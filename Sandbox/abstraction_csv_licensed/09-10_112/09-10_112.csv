8226348,comment,8224412,8225714,1,0,waps,,,"Thank you for this insightful comment. It really was a joy to read.<p>To some extent I feel you are avoiding the basic question, though. What do you think the solution is ? The only real argument in favour of capitalism is simply that it has survived where other systems have not. Natural selection.<p>Granted, economic systems haven&#x27;t always failed for &quot;good&quot; reasons. Some were conquered. Others built an economy based on oil, and oil ran out. Others strip-mined colonies. Islam built it&#x27;s civilization on slavery, and can be said to be a continuation of Rome (mostly of the bad parts of the Roman empire, but ...). But, like natural selection, there are no good and bad reasons, hell, there aren&#x27;t even really (known) reasons at all, and it doesn&#x27;t really matter &quot;whose fault it is&quot;, they failed, and when they failed, that was the end of the road. Capitalism, by contrast, has risen from the ashes more times than a drunk pyromaniac phoenix.<p>The vast majority of critiques on capitalism are simply expressing a refusal to change (in some cases ironically). In a way, it&#x27;s a form of conservatism, even if different from what we usually call conservatism. Or, in some cases, much worse : an attempt to resurrect dead societies (like the many attempts at resurrecting the caliphate we see now, hell, those even fight like the Roman empire did, which frankly justifies killing them all in my humble opinion, but ...). But sadly[1], there&#x27;s a reason these societies died (and in the vast majority cases, like the islamic one for example : good riddance). If you resurrect them, that reason will simply surface again, and kill them in the cradle.<p>Right now we are in a boom phase of capitalism, and yes, it looks like we may be at the end of the boom (then again, it&#x27;s looked like that for 10+ years now, and before that we had 1980, 1972, the cold war, 40-48, 30-40, 14-18, &quot;revolutionary&quot; Europe, and so on and so forth, and all of those look to me much, much worse than our current situation. So to some extent I feel inclined to say to people complaining about the economy &quot;big fucking whoop&quot;. But it certainly is getting a little bit worse. On the other hand today, I can name 50+ things that could easily resurrect economic growth, and only one of them needs to happen. We could discover a useful fusion principle, we could find a way to mine plate-edge methane gas, we could find a way to produce really cheap solar panels (we&#x27;re not too far from making that happen, actually), we could ... If you ask me &quot;what could anyone have done to avoid what&#x27;s coming&quot; in 1938 or 1912, I&#x27;d have said &quot;other than changing the religion/ideology of a great many people overnight, nothing can be done&quot;. Most societies never even tried to dig themselves out of the hole they dug for themselves. Certainly the Ottoman empire, for example, &quot;deserved&quot; what was coming to it. So did the kingdom of France. So did ... Most of these civilizations had people working in them that had at least the seeds of a solution to their problems, and, generally speaking, they killed those people. I&#x27;m pretty confident in saying that we are currently not doing that.<p>Anyway, I may be rambling a bit here. My question is simple : what is the way out of the current conundrum ? If history is a guide, the way out is simply a huge war, a new superpower, and a new dollar, and more capitalism. That&#x27;s what happened to Spain, Britain, Portugal, ... and that&#x27;s what fixed their versions of financial industry stupidities. I will agree that it looks like the US is getting buried in financial industry stupidities as well, but ... In history two economic systems have lasted really long times : slavery, and capitalism. The choice seems obvious to me.<p>[1] I say sadly out of nostalgia. But having read stories from the Roman empire, medieval China, from the Colonies, from the Ottoman empire (I talked to the grandfather of an Armenian immigrant. That was enlightening, especially the parts about the supposed &quot;tolerance&quot; of the Ottoman empire. By that standard Hitler was a saint), stories from 19th century Europe (hell, my granddad actually told me some stories his dad told him about what life was like in France between the revolution and WWI), I&#x27;d say it is a very good thing indeed that you can&#x27;t resurrect societies.",1409046435

You can&#x27;t make random phone calls. All phone calls are monitored and recorded to prevent abuse.  \nYou can&#x27;t call an inmate afaik, that would be a very low security facility, which I am not aware of.<p>Visitors are only by request and undergo security checks before, during and after visits. And yes, visitors are a huge security issue in prisons, but if you deny all visitors to prisoners, you&#x27;re in Guantanamo, not a normal prison anymore. There are different levels of security in prisons.<p>Internet access is much harder to control.  Encryption is, as you as a HN reader know, very easy to do on a computer, but hard using your voice.  Hiding information on a computer is easy, but very hard on a voice phone.\nThere have been prisons in the world that allowed internet access to inmates and there are problems with that, much as with visitors or phone calls.  It&#x27;s a balancing act to weigh those problems to the benefits. You just have to go into the discussion with open eyes about the problems that internet access would bring.  Imagine a pedophile convicted for sexually harassing children online, and giving him/her internet access in prison.  What an outrage.   Someone in a low sec jail for DUI could be given internet access, no problems. It happends, I&#x27;ve even seen a CEO run his company from within the jail. He was given supervised internet access to his companys financial system once a month, one guard watching pover his shoulder at all times.

Even syntax matters, although not that much.<p>It&#x27;s easy to get trapped in &quot;languages don&#x27;t matter&quot; attitude if you know a couple languages. The perspective changes drastically with mastery - being able to use a language to its fullest, as opposed to just using it - and with dozens more of learned languages.<p>A language is your baseline, a starting point for building things. How you build API, how you interact with outside world, how you accomplish common tasks depends on a language and language features. And it gets even more important as you climb the abstraction ladder. For example, at language level Scheme offers call/cc. You may say it doesn&#x27;t matter, as it&#x27;s just a language feature. But take a look at Racket continuation-based web server - it&#x27;s an impressive piece of work which solves a certain problem really well and is almost impossible to implement in some other languages (you don&#x27;t need continuations specifically to implement this, there are other features which would enable it). At a language level Lua offers coroutines, which in itself is not very impressive. But take a look at OpenResty: you can write code which looks perfectly normal and synchronous (no callback etc.) while still fitting inside of async by nature Nginx.<p>Anyway, thing you mention, like APIs, do matter too, but language features are equally important. Don&#x27;t dismiss them because you superficially know a few languages; rather learn some of them in depth and build real world things with them and I&#x27;m 97% sure you&#x27;ll see how language features matter.",1409044452

Finding minerals can be hard, especially in the north sea. The oceans are big. The difficulty is why there are still new deposits being discovered.<p>Exploration usually happens when the company doing it can hope to make money off of a successful discovery. They might even pay for the privilege. Imagine a scenario where a company finds a motherload of oil after a low probability exploration. Their exploration contracts (being signed before the deposits were known) guarantees them a huge profit. Unseemly, even. They are earning that  because they took a risk. Now they get their 100X. Try explaining that in an election year.<p>New technologies are constantly being invented that improve exploration, surveying & mining. This means that there are new possibilities every year impacting which mine/well is profitable (minerals can be extracted at a profit. These all change underlying economic realities. A $1bn per year mine can only make a slim profit in years where commodity prices are high. It employs many people. The next year commodity prices change or some new mining or processing technique (fracking is a huge gamechanger) mean that some complicated contract is now worth a whole lot of money. The $1bn goes from a 2% margin ($20m) to a 30% margin ($300m) and everyone want a piece of it.<p>Meanwhile government departments, unions, armies, etc are salivating over the prospect of this wealth.
