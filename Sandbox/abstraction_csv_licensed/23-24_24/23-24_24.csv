The company was run like a dysfunctional family.<p>On the whole, dysfunctional families are poor preparations for <i>anything</i>. That's why they are called dysfunctional.<p>The one thing I could maybe agree with -- in a dysfunctional family, sometimes the children learn to take on responsibility and budgeting at an earlier age. Maybe they learn to challenge authority. That may be an 'advantage' over some pampered brat, although a dubious one since it leaves less time and resources for studying or hacking or other growth opportunities. There are less damaging ways to learn responsibility.",1253750392
840348,comment,839724,839724,0,0,laut,,,"Government does a good job wasting resources. But fun to watch peoples ingenuity getting around restrictions. In Denmark until recently car importers used to transform Land Rover Discoveries (LR3 in the US) and other cars to auto campers (an RV in USA-language). You had to do some modifications for it to qualify as a ""camper"". Like the roof that needed to be able to be raised and it had a little kitchen. So they installed a token kitchen etc. The tax would be something like 60% instead of 180% (plus 25% VAT). And in Denmark you can still take the back seat out of most SUVs and station wagons for it to qualify as a van and get a discount on the tax. So a bunch of people drive around with cars without backseats. A waste of cars and resources.<p>I wonder what the true story of that chicken trade barrier is. Europe doesn't issue taxes or tariffs, because it's a continent, not a political entity. Turkey is transcontinental with most of it being in Asia.",1253750279

Getting paid for it would just be icing on the cake.<p>Of course, the pricing structure would be difficult, as would setting up the infrastructure for it. My (uniformed, by-the-seat-of-my-pants) best guess would be that subverting the current folding method of jobs would be the best way to do it. Accept jobs, send out to client computers, clients get paid based off of how many they complete. The problem arises from: sandboxing the jobs, to make sure they can't steal client info, and making it relatively easy to program jobs, while still allowing users to do various things to increase their performance (like using GPUs and the like).",1253749267

It seems to look like:<p>TechCrunch Breaks Embargo: Good for them: Spike to  traffic. Bad for competitors: lose lots of traffic, everyone already saw it. Bad for entity putting out embargo: it was there for a reason, whatever it was. (?) for users:  Unknown how this plays out for the user. It depends largely on the quality of TechCrunch's reporting versus other sites'.<p>TechCrunch does not break Embargo, another site does: Bad for TechCrunch: they get the downplayed traffic, but will still get a good chunk of it due to their size. Good for site that broke embargo: They get the spike, and walk off with a huge traffic spike. Bad for the rest of the competitors: they're still in the same case as everyone else. (?) for users, still.<p>No one breaks embargo: Business as usual for TechCrunch: Apparently they have the largest tech readership. They keep that when it comes to new stuff. Business as usual for the other sites. They get the same traffic proportion as usual, possibly modified if anyone has a particularly interesting take on the product. Good for the user: they get all the views at once, and get to make their own decision.<p>As far as I can tell, no embargoes fits with the last one fairly well, except the coverage will be spotty and the user loses out, because only sites currently staffed at the time the product comes out will be able to post about it, and they'll be rushing out as many updates as possible to grab traffic.",1253748791

840331,comment,839675,839675,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"There's a lot of ""short vs long"" going on in the comments here.  That seems silly to me.<p>Code should be written so as to completely describe the program's functionality to human readers, and only incidentally to be interpreted by computers.  We have a hard time remembering short names for a long time, and we have a hard time looking at long names over and over again in a row.  Additionally, short names carry a higher likelihood of collisions (since the search space is smaller), but are easier to ""hold onto"" for short periods of reading.<p>Thus, our conventions for naming things should take into consideration the limitations of the human brain.  The length of a variable's name should be proportional to the distance between its definition and its use, and inversely proportional to its frequency of use.<p>Global config setting that gets specified once and used in 4 places throughout the program?  10-20 characters is probably appropriate.  Might wanna go with UPPER_SNAKE_CASE to make it stand out a bit more, even.<p>Iterator variable that you define in a 3-line for loop and then never see again outside of it?  Call it ""i"".<p>Another way to look at this:  The first time you meet someone, you learn their full name.  When discussing them with someone else who knows them, you use just a single name.  If they're standing right there, you don't bother using their name, but just make eye contact, and maybe a ""Hey"".  Should be the same way with variables.",1253748615

Reading this makes me ashamed of every time I've thought and spoken this way.  (At least I can thank the author for providing that clarity.)  Unix programmers rarely tackle the kinds of problems that OO approaches are best and most necessary for.  When they do, they usually aren't acting as ""Unix programmers"" or ""systems programmers.""  I occasionally write performance-critical code that talks directly to hardware, and I have written embedded code that runs on that hardware as well.  Of course I wrote lean code without layers of goopy abstraction.  But I don't walk around with my chest puffed out just because I've written low-level non-OO code, because I've also written GUI applications using Eclipse RCP, which is plugin-based Java abstraction-on-steroids that makes architecture astronauts giddy.
