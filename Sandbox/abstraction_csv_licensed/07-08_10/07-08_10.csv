You should have <i>one</i> unit test that depends upon the location of the menu, and everything else should be isolated by stubs, shunts, mocks, whatever.  Otherwise, they aren't really unit tests, because they're testing more than a unit.<p>I didn't realize how wrong I was doing it until I got to Google.  (Then again, a lot of Google's best programmers are doing it wrong too.)  Perhaps this is because doing the right thing - mocking out your dependencies and testing <i>only</i> one feature per test - is often harder in the short term than just running all your code when you test the topmost layer.  But I think the point needs to be hammered home: most programmers who're doing ""unit"" testing are not doing <i>unit</i> testing, and their code would be much less brittle if they took the time to stub out lower layers.",1233733484
