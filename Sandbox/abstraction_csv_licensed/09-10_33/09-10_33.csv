1343778,comment,1341619,1341619,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>I don't accept either the heavy-handed liberalism that says progress is inevitable or the reflexive conservatism that says we're losing something precious by casting off tradition-for-tradition's-sake. However, I do believe the following:</i><p>Sigh. As long as you view this conversation in some kind of cookie-cutter, political-box mentality I doubt you are going to make much progress.<p>Think of it like this: We now have immediate multi-sensory input into people's brains in a way that the species has never had before. The big evolutionary question is: what are we going to do with it? Are we going to join together into some kind of hive mind? Are we going to become permanent couch potatoes? Is each person going to have some super-cognitive ability they never had before?<p>Look for drivers and patterns, not ideology.<p>The driver I see dominating right now is the push to control brain-time. Every business that is half-way technology-related is striving to get some time on your brain. They'll do that with Farmville, they'll do that with wikipedia, they'll do that with YouTube, and they'll do that with Google.<p>From an evolutionary standpoint, the optimization is not around survival of the fittest -- at least from the individual's standpoint. At least so far, some new piece of trivia you picked up last night on the net is extremely unlikely to allow you to pass along your genes and/or prevent another human from doing so. But looked at from the <i>application's</i> and startup's standpoint, there is an intense evolutionary process going on where apps that take up more brain time get funded (and have spin-offs, er, children) whereas apps that don't find that brain time do not. Eyeballs always win out. This is why your argument of better information quicker fails -- the information is not a selection criteria. It's just information.<p>The interesting question is whether or not this evolutionary process of applications being easier and easier to find and harder and harder to put down ends up having some effect on reproduction. What the Atlantic and other articles talk about is the immediate effects -- much more interesting are the multi-generational ones.<p>I'd much rather talk about patterns of behavior in a system than the motivations of those criticizing (or praising) it.",1273744716

I'd rather go with, ""whatever will produce the most savvy programmers."" In this light, there are good reasons to pick Scheme.  Before that, I would also opt for a simplified assembly language, with a simple compiler targeting that language.  For the first intro course, Python isn't a bad choice.

When I'm manipulating my history, I often really _want_ to have all the guts hanging out so that I can slice and dice them.  If git wasn't designed using the ""composable tools"" idea [1] then it would make this stuff a lot harder.<p>The tradeoff is that it makes the learning curve a lot steeper.  I understand that some developers don't want to know too much about their VCS, but I can't count the number of times when I have appreciated having an in depth knowledge of it [2].<p>I said this here once before, and I don't mind repeating it:  git is a power tool for power users.  It is also designed as VCS toolbox, so anyone who wants to write a more intuitive UI layered on top of git is welcome to.  There are a couple out there, but they don't seem popular.  I'm not sure why.<p>[1] Although this phrase also conjures the UNIX Hater's Handbook's take on it:  ""tools for fools""<p>[2] The next question is how much of the time do I get into these situations _because_ the guts are hanging out?  Is that the reason I need the power tools to get me out of trouble?  It's hard to judge because I'm too close to the trees to see the forest on this issue.",1273743855

To the untrained eye, it looks like this a simple linear progression of history, and you just want to record savepoints as you go along. CVS lets you pretend this is the case.<p>Actually, that's not the case at all. What you actually want to record is the changes you're making, and the relations between them. In the vanishingly small edge case where you never have any collaborators, never any experimental code, you never need to backtrack, you never need to work on more than one portion of the code at a time - this is isomorphous.<p>The rest of the time, it's not.

Write some code, put it up on Github, and <i>then</i> try to evangelize it.<p>---<p>[1] Actually, it isn't senseless, but a generic web app without a specific purpose is called a <i>framework</i>, and the main reason not to propose one is that everybody will yawn.
