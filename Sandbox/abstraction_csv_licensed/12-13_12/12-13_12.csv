266217,comment,265897,265897,0,0,shimon,,,"I love Perl, but its essential problem at this point is that it's lost momentum.  After over 7 years of waiting for Perl 6, a huge gulf has developed between the people who can influence language development and new users.  In this time, other language communities have taken great steps to attract new users, and in many cases they've been pulling in more former Perl hackers than converted Java/C++/etc folks.  In web apps, Rails and Django are king for a reason; they're excellent libraries that are well-documented and easy to choose because of broad support in the language's community.  Perl's Catalyst is workable (I've used it) but is tricky to install and configure, has inferior docs, and a thinner set of libraries.  And it isn't what all your friends are doing.<p>It might be narrowminded to blame Perl 6's schedule slippage (and the general shakeup in Perl leadership and Larry Wall's struggle with cancer) for the broader community decline.  But there was a time when, say in web apps, Perl was the default choice.  That default started to change when some smart hackers wrote some terrific libraries in Ruby and Python, and broad segments of the hacker world started to agree on roughly what features they expected in a web framework.  I'm not sure why those hackers didn't choose Perl, but if I had to pick exactly one thing, it would be Perl's awkward handling of references, a skill that might have been easily picked up by C hackers but seems exceedingly arcane to those reared on Java.",1217854083

266212,comment,265897,266188,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Regular expressions are expensive. I find a lot - actuially, most - of the things I'd do with RegExs in Perl can be replaced with string methods in Python.</i><p>They are not that expensive.  In perl, you pay for executing opcodes.  If you can do with one regex what would require 10 ""fast"" string manipulations, then the regex will nearly always be faster.<p>I imagine Python is similar; there is bookkeeping to be done every time you call a core string function.  If you can condense the operation into one call into the core, then you save yourself the bookkeeping overhead.<p><i>Additionally, it's also common for Perl users to use RegExs to do things like modify markup languages, which is extremely fragile - use a tree data structure and paths. Python has even has element trees built it in recent versions.</i><p>This has nothing to do with Perl.  You can write bad code and use bad techniques in any language.  I'll bet a Google Code Search will reveal tons of hand-built parsers written in Python.  Most people don't know there is a better way to solve a problem, so they use whatever they think of first.<p><i>Code should be written for the people who have to maintain it.</i><p>When you write code, expect that you will be the primary maintainer forever.  You will spend more time reading your own code than anyone else will, so optimize it for yourself.<p><i>Your beholders value simple code rather you selfishly saving a few keystrokes.</i><p>If you can't read Perl, perhaps it's because you don't know Perl.  I can't read Python.  Why?  Because I never bothered to learn it.  Does that make it intrinsically ""unreadable"" or ""unmaintainable""?  No; it just means I am dumb.  Don't blame the language for your own ignorance.",1217853550

266210,comment,266101,266117,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Smalltalk also has different precedence rules.  Assignment is highest, followed by unary ops, binary ops, then keyword messages.  In some cases, this results in expressions evaluating left to right.<p>This is often the biggest complaint from outsiders.  But it's easily solved by including parenthesis now and then.  In 10 years of doing Smalltalk, I've never encountered a situation where this is ever an issue.  I've never encountered a but caused by math expression precedence.  Newb Smalltalkers might make the mistake, but they generally correct it in the next second.  So much for the first impression of programmers who are unfamiliar with the language.<p>In 10 years of Smalltalk, I've also never encountered a situation where Smalltalk execution was slow -- it was always poorly designed (low-latency favoring in a high-latency environment) database IO.  If anything, I've always been impressed with how fast the commercial VMs are.<p>My point: the ""popular notions"" about programming languages are often as misleading as urban legends.",1217853287

Ruby has a major problem right now; module authors have no respect for each other... they will happily modify core functions (and other classes) when you load them.  This is not fun to debug.  Ruby is still very new, and it's still getting over the mistakes all languages go through.

Paypal have a similar sucking air through the teeth reaction, they're all scared of fraud.<p>I'm looking for solutions, and I have two in mind at the moment, one would work, but might negate the need for the business in the not too long term, the other might not even work in getting the banks to grant me a merchant account.<p>So, the first option is to use Paypal, and require the vendor to have a Paypal account, and have the customer make payments direct to the vendor, I know there are several billing applications around that let people raise invoices, but they require the vendor to have their own method of collecting payments, whereas I want to provide that for my customers as well.<p>The problem, as the various bank reps have explained to me, is that the people making payments are not buying anything from me, and that raises issues with fraud. So I was wondering if having the customers purchase ""tokens"" from me, and spending them on the services from various vendors. I'm not sure if this will be enough for the banks though.<p>Are there any other alternatives to being a 3rd party processing application? Any that I've missed?",1217851578
