7403990,comment,7401803,7402792,10,0,mercurial,,,"> A huge advantage of using a configuration management (CM) tool is that they&#x27;re &quot;idempotent&quot;. Idempotency basically means that you can run the directives over and over again safely.<p>They&#x27;re idempotent only as long as the configuration stays the same. If you removed this &quot;apt: package=XXX state=present&quot; line, XXX is not going to be magically uninstalled, but you may have a nasty surprise the next time you attempt to provision a second server with the same configuration and realize you&#x27;re missing a runtime dependency. That&#x27;s what I find fascinating about NixOS/NixOps: you can describe the entire state of the machine in a single configuration file (if you use the declarative style of package management). Of course, it won&#x27;t help you if:<p>- you already have a large number of non NixOS systems<p>- you need many packages not present in NixOS<p>- you&#x27;d like polished package management (the Nix package management still has a way to go before it reaches yum/apt ease of use)",1394870091

7403987,comment,7398970,7400811,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"Note that in a secured loan, the security is rarely for the full amount of the loan (mortgages being a notable exception).  Usually it covers only a fraction of it, but it&#x27;s there to increase the borrower&#x27;s &quot;skin in the game&quot;.  Rules also differ on whether or not the security itself is acceptable as discharging a loan&#x27;s obligations (e.g., in Spanish real estate lending, if the property itself isn&#x27;t sufficiently highly valued to pay off the loan balance, the borrower _remains_ on the hook for the balance, this is usually not the case in the US, where most mortgages are <i>non-recourse</i> loans.).  See also &quot;deficiency judgement&quot;.<p>In both secured and unsecured loans, <i>the debt itself is the security</i>, with a portion of the interest being attributable to the risk (default) component of the loan.<p>As for money supply, bank reserves are included in M2 which is used for inflation calculations, so I&#x27;d argue that yes, fractional reserve lending <i>does</i> increase money supply, as commonly used.",1394869858

The Navy does deep space reconnaissance over there! among other things...<p>And they didn&#x27;t detect a massive 777 flying north/south in and around the Indian Ocean?<p>That area is saturated in complex radar. Diego Garcia houses complex radar and satellite communications systems and who knows what else that is still classified.<p>Additionally, there are over 1,000 operational satellites in orbit!<p>IMO, this was a carefully and planned mission.<p>For all we know (tin-foil hat time) there could be behind the curtain negotiations with hijackers and/or missions being planned to recover the aircraft in case of wild extremists theories flying around on the Internet (0.1% on this) And as we all know today, nothing is that extreme anymore in the world we live in.<p>Disabling transponders takes three clicks of a wheel and it was most definitely done intentionally, the sharp, almost hairpin turn, this jet made and then strategically avoided radar are all signs of a sophisticated operation here.

7403920,comment,7403535,7403751,5,0,Zancarius,,,"Hijackers usually have a motive, and historically the motives typically involved some form of monetary exchange or demands for political asylum. You don&#x27;t generally hijack a plane unless you either want to go somewhere or you want something in return.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s impossible for a hijacking to be done quietly, with no demands, but it&#x27;s further complicated by the fact that the aircraft has to land somewhere. It&#x27;s also somewhat difficult to hide a plane as large as a 777, much less find an airport to land it where it&#x27;ll go unnoticed. This increases the likelihood that if it were a hijacking, it was probably similar to PSA flight 1771 [1] and more inline with a murder/suicide than a ransom.<p>Although, imagine the possibilities terrorists could use a 777 for. Load it with explosives, biological weapons, radioactive materials... It&#x27;s enough to make a politician want to ban flying altogether. Let&#x27;s hope they don&#x27;t find my comment.<p>Regardless, I&#x27;m not especially comfortable wagering a bet on the cause of MA370&#x27;s disappearance. My initial instinct was to presume foulplay or an in-flight fire. Now I&#x27;m not so sure.<p>If the aircraft isn&#x27;t found, I suspect this might become the mystery <i>of the century</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSA_Flight_1771"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSA_Flight_1771</a>",1394867757

The spelling and pronunciation are already completely regular and predictable. The grammar is straightforward and common to almost all European tongues. The vocabulary is mostly based on Latin with some Arabic variety thrown in, but it&#x27;s been standardized over the centuries so that a lot of it has a simpler and more natural morphology.<p>It&#x27;s a great second language: it&#x27;s fairly easy, the world&#x27;s second most widespread tongue, and spoken in warm countries with very friendly natives.
