Every day. Often to dictate complete SMS and Emails, while I'm driving, via my car's AD2P bluetooth mic, with all the ambient noise/etc present in a car on the interstate.

2682569,comment,2681290,2681290,2,0,Steko,,,"Been thinking about this article as I play his game (which is great).  Some thoughts:<p>(1) it seems like there's a big opportunity for someone to step in with a service that <i>just</i> handles the backend work on the Android Market.  Something less then a full fledged publisher but cheaper too.  If he's spending say 5% of his time dealing with these sorts of issues (I can't imagine the number is any higher or much higher) then one guy could, as he scales, work up to doing this full time, handle a number of mildly successful indie developers, take 5% from each and be mildly successful himself (more than mildly actually he'll be much more efficient meaning he can scale to many developers).<p>(2) Apple's App Store on the other hand could greatly benefit from some sort of Preferred or Trusted status for certain devs.  Maybe it prioritizes their review or allows them to bypass approval for purely bugfix releases.  Perhaps they have to fork over another 1-2% in additional fees or insurance or maybe revenues are deferred until the update passes review.",1308740099

Like the error handling where it assumes you want to return HTML (remember that Tornado was first written to handle RSS feeds). It also has really poor support for multiprocess mode, where if a child gets killed , the parent does not restart it. Or if the parent is killed, the children may continue running. Also the gzip implementation is broken: if the client mentions gzip even as q=0, Tornado will use it.

After about a year of abuse (certainly not the fault of the manufacturer), I had a phone with a smashed and no longer functional screen, microphone, wifi issues, etc. etc. Even the mute button no longer functioned.<p>Eventually I went into an Apple store, intending to purchase a new iPhone 4 (~$1,000USD here without subsidizing). The sales guy asked why I needed a new phone - had I used an iPhone before? I explained what had happened and showed him my shriveled hardware.<p>He disappeared out back and returned with two boxes. One contained a phone identical to my own - a white 32GB 3GS. The other had a brand new iPhone 4. He explained to me clearly and objectively that while he was happy to sell me a new phone, he could also replace my current phone for a quarter of the price. He explained that Apple was happy to do this as this was roughly similar to their cost price, and that some of the phone itself is salvageable (ie for precious metals).<p>I loved that they presented my actual options to me in a no-bs way. I loved that they wanted to make sure I wasn't spending an extra ~750USD on something I didn't need.<p>Both Apple and HTC clearly want to retain their customers for the long-haul.

2682522,comment,2682394,2682394,17,0,imurray,,,"I liked the discussion of transmitting game state for network play. Quick summary: Doom sent differences of state, which <i>had</i> to be received and therefore acknowledged. Quake sent the whole game state each time, but compressed, so it wouldn't matter if a transmission was lost.<p>Neither approach seems optimal from an information theory point of view. The Doom approach needs feedback, but communicating at the optimal rate of noisy channel doesn't need feedback. The Quake approach sends the game state redundantly, but across time simply repeats information, and repetition codes aren't optimal.<p>It could turn out that in this application the Quake approach <i>is</i> best, because for latency reasons it might not be possible to send long enough blocks for Shannon's theory to apply. The Quake approach is also nice and simple. However, here's the approach I have in mind: send the stream of deltas protected by a code that can cope with some of them being erased, such as a Digital Fountain Code [1]. Each message would contain deltas stored slightly redundantly and XORed with previous deltas. If we have all previous deltas then we are set, otherwise we'll have to wait for another packet or two before we can infer the deltas, but we don't need to bother telling the receiver that we lost a packet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_code</a>  but a much better resource is chapter 50 of <a href=""http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/book.html</a><p>EDIT: In response to replies by VMG and JoachimSchipper: I didn't mean to suggest they should have done anything differently.
