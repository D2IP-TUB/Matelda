Sun never made as much as IBM did, but the people who founded Sun made more than they otherwise would have.*<p>I don't disagree with your general arguments, but this bit is factually wrong. IBM's problems in the late 80's and early 90's were to do with the rise of the PC industry, not the Unix workstation. Yes, IBM had a dysfunctional Unix strategy during that period, and yes it lost sales (some to Sun) but it wasn't Sun that was killing it, it was the rise of client server computing.

Try reading Chinese characters.<p>The real challenge with learning Arabic is that no one speaks the classical/standard Arabic as a native tongue, each region has its own dialect, and so to be really effective at using Arabic to communicate with real life Arabs, you have to know a lot about 2 or 3 major dialects. Even in online writing, people mix standard Arabic with their own dialect or major dialects. If you understand Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, Egyptian, Syrian, and Iraqi dialects, then you can communicate effectively with 90% of Arabs.<p>Basically you have to learn several (related) languages before you can communicate like a native Arab in the middle east. It's like learning Latin, Italian, Spanish and French at the same time.<p>Reading is trivial in comparison.",1283667997

1664119,comment,1663784,1664092,0,0,dhess,,,"Oh, one more thing I forgot to mention.<p>Another problem with Bootstrap is that the students seem to be quite confused about control flow. They don't understand how the whole process starts, proceeds, and then repeats itself. The confusion occurs because the students are only writing callbacks, and are never exposed to the event loop of the game engine.<p>Scratch does not have this problem. Scratch programmers are entirely responsible for deciding how events are sequenced (when they need to be, at least; without explicit sequencing, everything in Scratch executes in parallel by default, which is how the real world works and is therefore familiar).<p>I think understanding control and/or data flow is a crucial concept for introductory programming. It helps the student develop a complete mental model for how programs, when executed, create dynamic processes. For my Bootstrap classes, I came up with a pretty silly real-world scenario in an attempt to explain to them what Scheme and the game framework were doing behind the scenes, to give the students at least some sense of ""who"" or what was causing their functions to execute, but I'm not convinced they really understood it. There was a bit too much magic going on for my liking.",1283667375
