However, this has nothing to do with ""app stores."" apt-get has been around way before the ubuntu software center, and if anything it goes way deeper than just ""apps."" If anything, this article is just bringing up the point that software management on linux (for the more technically inclined) is better than on mac, something that isn't quite exciting or new.<p>I think articles like these are just looking for trouble.

Your mind is more explorative in its creativity.

If you were to remember everything from a trip, the likelihood of most of it being useful or correct is probably pretty low.<p>Lastly, I agree that it is too dangerous -- I don't suffer from psychosis but nevertheless my one experience was not enjoyable. It turned bad; I believe I had a panic attack which I acted upon in the worst possible way. You do not want to experience feelings of failure on LSD. Trust me. My body created physical sensations based on my own thoughts and I lay on a bed shivering...<p>However, I guess it had a profound and positive effect on me. I realised that the experience was not the one that I wanted from life and it made me reflect on who I wanted to be and how I wanted to live.

Winning the game meant that I had to micro my units to their full extend, not letting them have a second to build detectors and jeopardize my plan so this really reinforces the notion that when you have an advantage you need to use that and get a bigger one.<p>A hard part of the game is that when you see that your tactic fails, you need to switch over to something else. When you have an air fleet and you realize that the enemy has marines, stalkers or any other anti air units, you need to build anti ground units instead and make use of your existing fleet, like attacking the enemy base while their army is busy fighting your second army.<p>The game also lets you take risks, you can go build cannons next to someone's base, you can quickly strike down a base with reapers, you could destroy a base with void rays or you could frustrate the enemy with mutalisks. These are all high risk, high reward moves, you could win the game in a few minutes, but you could also lose it if the enemy is well prepared for your tactic.<p>You could take a lot of real life situations and turn them into an SC game.

2502667,comment,2502103,2502103,3,0,cageface,,,"Obj-C, at least in the last few generations of mobile hardware, is a competitive advantage for Apple. It makes it easy to write fast, low-level code in C, and then to move transparently up to a much higher level of abstraction for non-critical code. With the relatively underpowered processors of today's mobile devices, this kind of control is important.<p>However, Obj-C completely falls on its face for anything of real algorithmic complexity. Working with complex, nested data structures and more sophisticated algorithms is <i>very</i> awkward, and manual memory management only clouds things further. In the longer run this may become a liability for Apple.",1304237386

The biggest issue is PHP's reliance on global functions vs Ruby's methods for strings, numbers, arrays, etc.  So, for every PHP global string function, for instance, you'd need to pull out one of the arguments and call an equivalent method on it.

2502654,comment,2502018,2502191,1,0,digamber_kamat,,,"I agree. Technical challenges are not always deal with issues of processing and memory. In case of web the real problem is scalability and communicating processes and system components. May be we will soon come up with some formalism and technologies that will make scalability a dumb problem but then we will have a new set of technical challenges to be solved. So the demand for highly skilled people who care about their work will only increase with time.<p>In my opinion it is wrong to assume that a language like Python is better than C. They are all independent of each other. Python is simply useless when it comes to real-time processing where hard deadlines are required, you cant chose anything except Ada or some flavor of C. They each have their strengths and that is why they are still alive.",1304236878

2502651,comment,2502103,2502103,39,0,zoul,,,"I find it surprising that there are so many people bashing Objective-C here in the comments. I have been programming in Objective-C for living since the iPhone SDK came public and I came to love both the language and the libraries.<p>I think that many people who despise Objective-C syntax are simply not programming long enough in the language to overcome the initial knee-jerk reaction. Mostly the issue seems to be the message passing syntax, which I find very readable and self-documenting. What else should matter if not this?<p>Then theres comments about speed. I have written two action games for the first-generation iPhones and I have never encountered a performance problem caused by the runtime. Over 99% of the time I could stick to high-level code without resorting to C to gain speed. That says <i>a lot</i> about performance for regular applications.<p>Block syntax could be better, I cant use closures with such ease as in Perl (for example). But this is one of the things that have to do with Objective-C being a relatively thin layer atop of C. And that I see as a huge win, because you can very easily and naturally mix higher-level Objective-C code with plain C APIs that are very common on most systems. And if you want some lower-level bit-twiddling trickery for performance reasons, you are free to go. For me, C is a very elegant language and Objective-C takes out most of its rough corners.<p>Saying that Objective-C could be replaced by something smarter like Lisp or Haskell is simply ignoring the reality. Objective-C has very low language complexity, both the building blocks and their interactions are simple and there are few surprises. This is a huge advantage both for the newcomers and for programmers that deal with the stack most of their working hours.<p>The manual memory management first seemed like a chore to me after coming to Objective-C from Java, but the rules are dead simple and after a few weeks you dont think about the memory management any more.<p>Yes, Objective-C is not hip. So what? Its a pragmatic and reasonably expressive language that gets the job done. I dont think that replacing it would serve any real purpose  and thats a very good reason to survive.",1304236821
