It genuinely sounds like you don&#x27;t trust it to come back up which is not something I could sleep on. Things fail, sometimes violently.<p>Even with our company which has in in-house ops team and our own colocated kit, we expect process failures and restarts and plan accordingly. No sleep is lost even when something explodes at 2AM (other than for the ops team, who in this case you contracted out).",1411808321

8376507,comment,8376376,8376376,21,0,myhf,,,"> If there&#x27;s a bug, it&#x27;s not in bash, but in apache and the\nother internet facing programs that call bash without properly\nvalidating and controlling the data they pass to bash.<p>It&#x27;s absurd to think that a transport layer should be responsible for &quot;validating&quot; all possible contexts in which the data it transports could be used. How is apache supposed to know the difference between <i>using</i> a magic string and simply <i>mentioning</i> it? How is apache supposed to know what magic strings apply to all possible subprocesses of sh that inherit environment variables? A program that receives user data has to be responsible for validating that data, and it&#x27;s not productive to characterize the lack of validation as a &quot;feature&quot; just because it can be used to provide functionality.<p>This kind of misguided thinking leads to practices like mod_security refusing to allow comments that contain the magic strings &quot;1=1&quot; because they might be trying to inject SQL into something.",1411808256

Mongo seemed to be the one I could most easily wrap my head around, but still.<p>I was never sure, though, if that meant I had never faced a problem suitable for one of these DBMSs or if my mind is just so warped by years of using relational engines (mostly Postgres, or SQLite for simple projects) that I could not think of modeling my data any other way.<p>Recently though, I had to get familiar with the database schema of the ERP system we use at work, plus some modifications that have been done to it over the years, and it kind of feels to me like somebody was trying force a square peg through a round hole (i.e. trying to model data in relational terms, either not fully &quot;getting&quot; the relational model or using data that simply refuses to be modeled in that way).<p>I sometimes think the people who wrote the ERP system might have enjoyed a NoSQL DBMS. Then again, with a multi-user ERP system, you <i>really</i> want transactions (personally, I feel that ACID-compliant transactions are single most useful benefit of RDBMS engines), and most NoSQL-engines seem to kind of not have them.",1411808145

Every developper should know how hard it is to parse textual data vs well defined binary in a secure and fool proof way. Yet every damn internet piece of infrastructure is based on handling textual data, mash it up, pass it around, escape and unescape it in hundreds of stupid formats. No wonder that most security troubles surfacing over the years are some form of abuse of this crazy design flaw: buffer overruns, sql injection, the openssl bug a few month back and now this. Let&#x27;s go back to sanity and use well defined binary protocols where there is no damn way to send a command by text but only very explicit semantics, and stop the unix way of thinking that text should be more than a human interface. Text should never be used as a command language in between complex programs. Period.",1411808126

But I don&#x27;t think this author knows how deeply the bug runs, either; the most recent way to exploit it is to export an environment variable of, say, ls to a bash function. [1]<p>Usually the amount of toxic environment variables are considered to be finite; PATH, LD_PRELOAD, etc., etc. If the name of any executable on the PATH is dangerous, than the number of toxic environment variables is infinite -- are we to scan the entire PATH for each environment variable to make sure it isn&#x27;t dangerous? What if the CGI script updates PATH?<p>There is no way to solve this problem with sanity checks. I&#x27;ve yet to peek at the source, but I&#x27;m told this feature is vital to implementing things like backtick operators. I think it is too dangerous however, and I don&#x27;t want shellshock to become a class of bug rather than an instance of toxic environment variables. We&#x27;re going to have to rip this feature out and re-implement large portions of functionality.<p>The author is right that this is a product of bash being written in a more trusting time. This is not the first nor the last time the 1970s security models will come back to bite us.<p>edit: forgot reference:<p>[1] <a href=""http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/741"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/741</a><p>edited to add:<p>Also, Apache does have a mechanism to filter out toxic environment variables; headers are added as HTTP_HEADER_NAME, because its generally the names of environment variables that allows them to be dangerous and not their content.

The Mongo implementation was shot after about three months of wasted time after failure in pre-production testing. It was rolled back at great cost to SQL Server with a light document-style abstraction as Mongo failed miserably on precisely what you said: reliability, consistency, scalability and storage management.<p><i>Proper relational databases</i> (PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server in my scope of experience) can take an absolute incredible amount of punishment without breaking <i>any</i> guarantees.

8376480,comment,8376376,8376376,43,0,ahy1,,,"> This feature is documented under the -f option of the export built-in command.  The implementation detail of using an environment variable whose value starts with &quot;() {&quot; and which may contain further commands after the function definition is not documented, but could still be considered a feature.<p>This undocumented implementation detail is also a limitation on the use of regular environment variables, and should be documented. When reading documentation about a mechanism, I expect that special magical strings which change behaviour of the mechanism are clearly documented. If such documentation had existed, someone might have noticed it and guarded against it.<p>> Assumedly programs like apache filter out environment variables properly.  But unfortunately, in the validation of input data, they fails to validate correctly input data because they don&#x27;t expect that data starting with &quot;() {&quot; will be interpreted by their bash child processes.  If there&#x27;s a bug, it&#x27;s not in bash, but in apache and the other internet facing programs that call bash without properly validating and controlling the data they pass to bash.<p>It isn&#x27;t easy to validate and control data against an unknown magical feature in one of many possible shells.<p>>   But on the other hand, it is free software and not difficult to check the source to see as the nose in the middle of the face, what is done.  When reusing a component with missing specifications and lacking documentation, checking the source of the implementation should be standard procedure, but it has clearly not been done by Apache or DHCP developers.<p>I think the shell is specified in POSIX/SUS. Checking the source of all possible open-source shells would be a huge job. I don&#x27;t know how they should check source code of the closed-source shells. I don&#x27;t blame them for using the environment variables according to available documentation.<p>Edit: typo",1411807140

It can be either good or bad, but you won&#x27;t find an example on how to store and query whole documents with a map/reduce implementation on an SQL database. Both can be either a good fit or a bad fit to your needs - I&#x27;ve seen project that leveraged CouchDB to basically return all data for any given view with a single query from a pre-calculated view, something which would have impossible with an SQL database. That&#x27;s a good fit.

8376447,comment,8376237,8376237,12,0,michaelkeenan,,,"Tentatively - this might not really be much of a problem? In many situations, we deliberately make sure we have excess capacity because it&#x27;s better to have too much than too little. For example, I have a server running idle most of the time, but it&#x27;s available to pick up a large long-running task when a user requests it. Analogously, when catering for an event, people often aim to have more than enough food for almost all scenarios, so they&#x27;ll throw away food almost all the time. Running a restaurant is catering an event every day. When I was a teenager, I worked at Subway and we&#x27;d try to have more than enough bread (we only ran out once when we didn&#x27;t anticipate a large sports-win-based city-wide party), so we&#x27;d throw away excess bread at the end of each day.<p>Of course, people are starving and that&#x27;s terrible. But reducing food waste in developed countries doesn&#x27;t seem like a powerful lever to reduce it. Non-wasted food isn&#x27;t going to be transported to developing nations. Reducing food demand would likely decrease food prices, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect a large decrease. If my understanding is correct, the food supply is quite elastic, meaning we can easily produce more if there&#x27;s people willing and able to pay for it.<p>I think that the two main problems behind starvation are the lack of purchasing power of the poverty-stricken, and broken political systems. Solving those would eliminate starvation, even if the developed nations waste as much food as they like.<p>(I&#x27;m no expert on this and welcome any corrections or opposing views.)",1411805883

Shell Command Language, 2.2 Quoting except for the space character.<p>Needless to say, the entire BSD family is not affected by this bug as bash is not the default shell and to be fair a lot of Linux distributions are not affected either. If bash is your Linux distributions /bin/sh, OR you have applications directly calling bash, you should be telling them to get with the times as most people have since moved on to ash, dash or busybox for more efficient processing.<p>Regardless, shell is such an important in part of the system - it allows non programmers to &quot;do things&quot;. Thanks to the dhcpcd hook system, a user was able to start tcpdump on hotplugged interface before dhcpcd actually started using it during the boot process. Why he wanted to do this, I don&#x27;t know, probably for some debugging. But the point is, how would he have done this without shell hooks?<p>The important thing to take away from this is don&#x27;t lock yourself into one technology - strive to be portable. dhcpcd works on many OS&#x27;s, libcs, shells and userland tools. If any of them prove faulty, swap them out - including dhcpcd itself! But please at least tell me why you&#x27;re swapping dhcpcd out so I can improve it :)",1411805558
