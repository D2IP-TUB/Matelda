9346089,comment,9341687,9345623,0,0,nullc,,,"Markets are frequently manipulated and distorted, they fail and fault and such.<p>But they&#x27;re not keeping consensus ledgers for limited supply cryptocurrencies.  Any of these failures or faults can allow a coin to be spent twice (or other mutually excluded transaction) with parties that have different views of the system, the result-- and any transaction which is casually depended on the conflict-- can never be part of a common system.<p>So it&#x27;s like someone manipulates the market economy to  convince you to buy a cheeseburger most other parties think they sold to someone else, and now your hand cannot interact with your neighbor&#x27;s door because your hand contains atoms that-- as far as your neighbor&#x27;s door is concerned-- aren&#x27;t part of your hand but are instead part of my foot.<p>Markets are a tool. They have their applications and limitations, building the security of a cryptocurrency in an adversarial environment out of them sounds like a plan for failure. No less than using a cryptosystem in a place where you really needed a market may not give great results.<p>But you don&#x27;t have to take my word for it, the prior consensus model in Stellar _already_ faulted, all on its own when, the requirement for the trust topology was violated. This fault wasn&#x27;t a surprise, I (and others) called it out years before-- but the vulnerability of the system was publicly ignored by Stellar&#x27;s creators while they ran Ripple and Stellar&#x27;s advisers (including Mazieres, who was an adviser listed on the Stellar site on day one) even as they facilitated the sale of their ripple-reboot asset to the general public. It was not acknowledged until it knocked their system out. The improved consensus may better confines the failure domain, but retains the property that the safety of the consensus is largely external and depends on particular topological constraints without a procedure that provides any assurance the constraints are likely to be met.<p>Another response to me argues that it will probably be fine; but this flys in the face of reason. The same property existed before and it demonstratively wasn&#x27;t fine.<p>If you look at the old BCT thread, I was a big fan of the original ripple IOU system, before ripple labs bought the name, and had recommended it as a potentially fruitful area to many people. The original system could potentially have been implemented without any global consensus at all, which was a large part of why I found it interesting-- Global consensus is enormously costly. But functionality like a new cryptocurrency currency for the purpose of funding the company and the integrated non-interactive rippling (which apparently has been largely turned off in ripple now due to other security vulnerabilities) brought back in the global consensus requirement. (The result was that I felt I had to go edit all my old posts to remove my recommendations, since the system was wildly changed to be something else)",1428562391

Wow, so many replies, favourites and retweets to my brand. I’m feeling so good. But, what’s next? Are they our customers? What can I do to make them more loyal and spending more money in our products or services?&quot;<p>&quot;Oh my god! So many people feel negative about our brand! Why? Which product? How can I resolve this? And… Can I really believe this?&quot;<p>- Social media analytics software is not cheap and worst if you couldn’t get values from it. You have to find the insights that really matter to your business.<p>- At the end of the day, sales matter. Sustainable sales is the result of the loyal and love from your customers for your products and services. That’s what insights are ultimately about: identifying what needs to be improved.<p>- So, rethink the metrics that really matter to your brand today. Review the social media consultants and insights tools that you are using, if they provide real impact to your brand, most probably sales.",1428560726

9345996,comment,9338812,9341126,0,0,itsjareds,,,"I guess we find the same problems in the wild enjoyable. I spent a few nights procrastinating on homework to brainstorm how I could try to find the most efficient walking path between points on campus. I figured that I would need to be able to represent the campus on some sort of plane where each point has a value referring to its elevation, and then finding the geodesic. I figured I could refer to some physiology literature and find if anyone has tabulated average energy expenditures for walking at different grades (downhill, flat, or uphill). Now, my math skills are really sub-par (haven&#x27;t gotten past single variable calculus), so this question had me asking various physicist friends how to solve the problem. I just found myself learning along the way.<p>I&#x27;m curious how you determined efficiency for each of the candidate walking patterns. Did you compare only the traveled distance, or did you also take into account the energy spent per unit distance? I think that could make a difference if, for example, you had these walking strategies:<p>Walking strategy S => A &quot;normal&quot; human gait, except you travel in an squiggle path (i.e. not a straight line) to your destination.<p>Walking strategy T => Do continuous jumping jacks while walking, but continue in a straight path.<p>S may travel a longer distance, but will exert less energy overall and therefore be more efficient than T. Now, that&#x27;s a pathological scenario, but I wonder if your walking pattern could have the same issue where you are actually exerting more energy despite walking a shorter distance. It&#x27;d be interesting to do more research on the biophysics of how your body moves.",1428559695
