Or at least you are supposed to.<p>To get a ""good job"" you get training. That's usually a job you get <i>after college</i>. You go to college (for a Bachelors) to learn how to think rigorously logically and to learn the fundamentals of your field. That's of intrinsic value, irrespective of whether it gets you a job. If you enjoy and have a passion about the field you study, all the better (on the other hand if you chose to study CS to ""make a lot of money"", you get to miss out on the biggest advantage of a programming career - doing what you enjoy for a living).<p>When an employer gives you a ""college hire"" position (which is often the only way into some mature companies, unless you're already wildly known and successful), that means they're making an investment in you. Education (or lack thereof) is one way for them to gauge the risk of said investment.<p>As I've also said in earlier posts, if you're worried about outsourcing and/or your job going to entry-level candidates - then you need to pick up domain specific knowledge.<p>Domain specific knowledge builds on these fundamentals (of computer science and mathematics) and can't be looked up on google.",1231966669

In this last respect it is typical of the genre; Michael Lewis, for example, tends to focus on miscalculation of risk, and particularly on the defects of the Black-Scholes model for pricing options---based in large part on his experience as a Big Swinging Dick at Salomon Brothers in the '80s.<p>Based on my reading of a bunch of these economic diagnoses, I'd like to suggest a two-part litmus test for addressing the 'real cause' of the crisis:<p><pre><code>  (a) Explain the system of central banks and fractional reserve banking.\n\n  (b) Connect (a) to the present crisis.\n</code></pre>\nI've become convinced that any explanation that falls short of this test invariably misses the forest for the trees.",1231966378

434245,comment,434190,434190,0,0,mdasen,,,"I know PG posted that YC would like to fund a Craigslist competitor.  The issue is that it's hard to build the number of people needed to reach a critical mass.  Likewise, it's not that eBay is so great, it's just the only place with that many people.<p>The CL search is really simple - really just whole word matches.  That makes it hard to search for things that haven't been adopted by the CL community as keywords for items.  I'm guessing this might be related to the amount of hardware they run.  While search isn't that taxing a thing to do, it isn't necessarily easy (especially on CL's budget which doesn't rake in dough from VC or ads).<p>Think about comparing it to something like Digg.  CL has more traffic (<a href=""http://siteanalytics.compete.com/craigslist.org+digg.com/?metric=uv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siteanalytics.compete.com/craigslist.org+digg.com/?me...</a> - go to visitors->visits monthly and engagement->pages per visit).  About 3.5 times the number of visits and about 10 times the number of pages per visit.  So, CL is getting 35 times the amount of traffic of a major site like Digg.  It's hard to scale up to 17.5 billion page views per month (24M per hour, 6,800 per second) - especially when you're not monetizing most of that.  Comparatively, Digg is getting a mere 200 page views per second.<p>I'd love to see improvements to CL, but I feel like some of them would definitely require more hardware.  CL wants to be independent with as little commercialness as possible.  In the end, that leaves CL what it is - a bastion of whatever goes where it's also hard to find things.",1231965971

The barriers to entry are small: one really good SysAdmin and enough money to rent a full rack with power and servers.<p>see, I think that if you buy less than a full rack, sure, you get eaten alive.  But if you can fill a full rack and 1 30A 208V circuit, the savings as you buy more space diminish. Again, hosting is a commodity, and most of the economies of scale are available almost at the retail level.  (in this case, from what I've seen the full rack with 1 208V 30A circuit is about the minimum you need to buy to get a reasonable price, but buying 10 racks like that doesn't get you much of a discount.)<p>SysAdmin time... well, really you need at least 2 SysAdmins, for reasonable coverage, but one can be less experienced (but still very, very careful!)    Now, two sysadmins can handle more than one rack, so you do gain benefits if you scale out the capacity to what your two guys can handle.<p>Look at amazon EC2, they are still charging $70/month for 1.7GB ram.  That was a pretty good price, in 2006. Think about how many of those you can fit on a $4000 dual quad-core system with 32GB ram.   that's a lot of money.<p>From what I have seen consulting for large companies, they don't get a discount on hardware or people, either.  Sure, they might give dell millions of dollars, but I pay $1.5K per 32G box less just 'cause I buy motherboards with 16 ram slots and use 2gb modules, while the dells use motherboards with 8 ram slots, requiring expensive 4GB modules.<p>And SysAdmins, well, from what I have seen good people are much cheaper for small companies (at least in part because small companies can hire people and then easily fire them if they aren't that great.)",1231965263

I couldn't agree more.<p>I have no idea why it's so common for people to consider it a virtue to coddle insane and irrational behavior.<p>Look, if someone tells you they feel very strongly that running across a busy highway is a safe thing to do, you'd think that person was nuts, right? because we recognize that emotion is not a tool of cognition, and that using it in that manner is a really really bad idea. So what about a person who doesn't know how to communicate properly and tries to deal with various problem solving tasks that come up in life via emotion? does the fact that it's a few levels of abstraction removed from concrete facts somehow make it fundamentally different?",1231964078

At the least, an education (university or not) could teach you that there are ways to state your point beyond using ""fuck"" in the title of a blog post: if you're talking about ""selling"" yourself, you may start off by not being insulting.<p>Second, if you're <i>just</i> talking about vocational training and job preparation, a college degree in some field and from some schools can show that you have the capacity for approaching a topic with mathematical rigour and know the fundamentals of Computer Science (as opposed to fashionable frameworks and APIs). There are many other ways to do that - but a college education also buys you a great deal of free time (something that hackers in college probably won't realize until they're done), exposure to smart people and new ideas; finally  it's a chance to fulfill other intellectual curiosities (take courses in other sciences, history, philosophy, so forth).<p>Third, starting your business does not conflict with going to college. More often than often than not, I've seen people who have never attended a university (as opposed to attended and dropped out when they had something more compelling) simply take full time jobs right away, usually in systems administration or web front-end development.<p>Both of these are essential and great skills to have (especially in a start-up), but you can't build a product on that expertise <i>alone</i>: you can build a web design or systems administration consulting shop, but consulting won't (usually) bring you an exit.",1231964008

If the Sony Reader I've played with is any indication, the screen is really all that matters, the button arrangement on the Kindle is considered almost perfect, from what I understand.)<p>That said, I think what some of the critics are seeing is a repeat of the Newton.  That was Apple's first stab at a portable ""smart"" device that overreached; it was expensive and its user experience was mostly alien.  Because of its failure, the first successful device in that market space was the much inferior Palm Pilot, and as such, the Newton may be perceived as setting back or delaying the mainstream acceptance of a fully powered smart device via premature birth.  (The sector really didn't regain the same capability level in the mainstream until the Blackberry and iPhone came on the scene.)  The Kindle might be doing the same thing with the ""PADD"" (I'm thinking Star Trek here) concept by focusing on books and focusing the UI on that exclusively.
