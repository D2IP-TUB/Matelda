The quality of the code, including maintainability, is a result of various trade-offs.  We don't know what compromises the developer was making at the time.  We don't know what was the highest priority at the time.  May be they were short of money and working code however shitty produced at the shortest amount of time was the most important.  Suck to be the guy doing the maintenance but if there's no working product, there would be no maintenance.<p>We programmers have a ugly tendency to judge less than stellar codes written by others.  It made us feel superior to pick apart mistakes others have made.  The fact is software development is a series of technical and non-technical trade-offs.  I certainly had fell in the same trap before.  These days I just appreciate they can ship a working product and get it off the ground.",1369450725

Then, when this person is sentenced, the judge can rule about restricting access to these materials anymore (for instance, restricting him from getting a job in industry).

5766177,comment,5765759,5765759,36,0,rorra,,,"Its not a big issue since we (Argentines) can open a company in Uruguay which is pretty close, or even a LLC online (U$S 250 per year). And probably most people doesn't know, but then we can get U$S in a bank account in Uruguay, and instead of change them for Argentine pesos in the Argentine banks (AR$ 5 = U$S 1), we can sell it on the street (AR$ 9 = U$S 1), and earn a 80% revenue because of stupid laws, crazy, right?<p>The main problem we have now, is that the government spends a lot of money on social plans to get people to vote them (instead of creating real jobs, obama care?), and they steal too much money as well (google for ""Lázaro Báez"", ""Raúl Copetti"", ""Rudy Olloa"" among others) that they ended with an artificial inflation of 25% every year. So people started to buy U$S and other currencies to be able to save their money, and the government cut this right from the people (so they make you by law, to save your money in AR$, and your money will be devaluated 25% every year, you can invest if you have enough money, if you do well, the government takes 50% on your earnings, if you do bad, the government doesn't give you the 50% of the looses, and good luck having enough revenue from your investments in order to avoid loosing the annual 25% :P).<p>I also have to mention that even when we are in a capitalist economy, the politicians in Argentine says all the time that we have a big economic problem because of evil business people, who run the business and increase the prices and make all this inflation problem, so while most of the countries in Latin America got thousands of millions of dollars in investments (and like Uruguay, they are starting to create laws to avoid so much money getting into the country so quickly), we don't know what to do or how to get foreign investments into the country. Why would you invest in Argentine if they are going to tell you that the inflation is your fault, that you are evil and most important, they won't let you to get your revenue to other country if you want to? So they had a brilliant idea on the last week, they are creating a law where everyone can get U$S to Argentine, they are going to give you a ""bond"" in exchange, and if the money came from drug deals, terrorism or whatever, it doesn't mind, the government is going to do the laundry service that the mafia usually do, for free!!!<p>Anyway, Argentine is getting aligned to countries like Cuba, Iran, Venezuela, and its following their politics, nothing good can came from that, but what can you expect from a government that used to put bombs on the street and kill innocent civilians? I would never ever understand how these people got into the government, or how these people ended giving ""Ethic"" classes in public universities, real story. Our last defense minister was an active member of ""Montoneros"", a terrorist organization in Argentine, they killed members of the military, they put bombs on the street where they killed civilians, tortured military members (google for ""coronel Larrabure"") and she ended being the defense minister? Can you imagine Al Qaeda member managing the USA Army?<p>Our president, who talks all the time about the last military government and human rights, made a lot of money with that government by using the ""Martinez de Hoz"" law, so she worked for the banks, she put pressure to the poor people that couldn't pay his house loans, and told them ""You are going to loose your house, and you won't get any money, or you can sell me the money for pennies, and I'll take care of the debt"", and then went to talk with his clients (the banks) and get a better deal for the current house loan, that's the way she got rich, after stealing money from the poors, she and her husband got into politics, being a governor of a State (Province, Santa Cruz) they sold by law a company that is call YPF to private holders, and took all the money under their name out of the country in U$S (and now she said that U$S is an evil currency), we never saw that money again, she got elected president, and now she said that Menem government was worng (another dumb ass who gave all the government companies away and did a lot of corruption things), and bough YPF back for a lot of money. Now the company is filled with a lot of persons that just support her government, they steal a lot of money and we import most of the petroleum we consume (being a petroleum producer, we have to import petroleum).<p>And most people in Argentine loves Kichner (54%) in the same way most people here loves Obama, so start paying a lot of attention to what's going on in Argentine, because you have the same kind of ""Populist Government"" that we had on many countries in Latin America for over the last years.\nI also forgot to talk about security, it doesn't exist, a uncle of my girlfriend (crazy uncle) made her wife to starve to death, he tied her to bed and waited until she died. He got 14 years on jail, then he went out and formed a new family. People who does violent robberies or whatever, they got into the police station and get released to the next day, last day, one person went with a gun into a federal court, the police got him, and he spent on the police station a couple of hours, threating all the people saying that we belonged to ""La Campora"", an organization that supports Cristina Kincher and was founded by his son. If you get robbed in Argentine, you usually say ""Thank you"" to the robbers because they didn't take your life, and they do it a lot, all the time, common business in Argentine. At this point, we would love to have a ""Second Amendment"", the right to have a gun and defend ourselves, pretty bad we never had it. You have this right and you are going to give it away, smart move.<p>And by the way, if you start seeing a lot of smart Argentine developers in USA, don't get surprised, we are trying to get away from the country while we still have the right to do it (if we leave the country, then we loose all our money, no way to buy foreign currency even if you decide to leave the country).",1369450090

Even for low-level code, it never makes sense to step out of array bounds.<p>You must understand that from the low level perspective, the array and its bounds do not exist.  This is an abstraction.  An allocator needs to chop up and slice a larger block of memory and give different segments to different callers.  You cannot do this if something is enforcing bounds.<p>What you <i>can</i> do is build higher level abstractions that track bounds and do runtime checks at every access.

Talking DICOM to the various modalities isn't <i>that</i> big a deal (although they all have weird bugs, and DICOM is a disgusting protocol), but good support for those stupid Plasmon archivers would be useful, or just figuring out a good client support option for local-to-workstation DVD burners.  As for interop, the big issue is usually HL7/HIS integration at hospitals (for DoD, it was AHLTA, and for the VA, Vista, and for everyone else, usually EPIC but sometimes Practice Fusion).  I think even the worst PACS is usually better than most hospital HIS/EHR.<p>It was <i>really</i> funny when I was supporting an ActiveX-based system and every single one of the doctors had a Mac personally, and I used a Mac running VMware windows as my primary machine.  I think the percentage of radiologists (or really, doctors in general) using Macs is >75%, but the hospital deployments are always Windows.<p>One good way for a new PACS or RIS to get started would be in training environments.  Telerad is the other good way (sending CTs, and usually several studies, over a VSAT network with ~16/4M bandwidth for all of theater, was interesting -- especially since the goal was to always beat the patient to the facility to give surgical teams time to study the studies.  Easy for the 8h ride to Landstuhl, hard for the <60 minute medevac helecopter from Jalalabad to Bagram.)<p>What surprised me is a lot of people wanted to at least be able to read reports (and usually look at images) on an iPad.  Some rads even wanted to read on an iPhone screen (!!!) so they didn't have to get out of bed, although that was for things like sprained ankles and they'd read for real the next day.  A Retina iPad is a pretty adequate device, though, honestly; it would be amazing to see what a Retina MacBook Pro 15 could do.  (for everyone else, a radiology monitor is often $10-20k and approximately Retina resolution; there are some special FDA regulations about the screens for uniformity, but fundamentally they're 2-3x overpriced for what they are.  A decent IPS LCD is perfectly adequate in many cases, particularly for CT/MR/US which are low resolution; mammography is the main area where <i>really</i> high quality screens matter (often black and white, 3-5MP).  And the high quality screen really only matters for a radiologist; for every other doctor reviewing the images, a good quality normal monitor is perfectly adequate, as the rad writes a text report and marks up the images to identify anything important.)",1369449523
