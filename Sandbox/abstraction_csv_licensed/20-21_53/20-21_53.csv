In fact, it should not be searchable. You should not be searchable. And there's no getting around that. No one except the people I personally tell should know that I'm part of this network. The word 'clique' comes to mind when I think of what could beat Facebook at it's own game. In school, college, or in your job, you can only get into a certain clique or group if they personally invite you and deem you trustworthy and close enough to be part of the gang. On a network such as this, you could have different cliques - one for your family and relatives, one for very close friends, and one for your immediate family let's say. That's about it.<p>I often share things with a handful of my close friends via email. I don't put it on Facebook because I have a lot of just ""acquaintances"" that I don't want to share this stuff with.<p>I think a network where the concept of ""adding a friend"" doesn't exist, nor does the concept of ""public"" is probably what will take some fraction of people away from Facebook.

That's why you find tetris, web browsers, and e-mail clients written for Emacs. There's a great culture of sharing your work too[1], so Emacs can be a powerful toolkit that supersedes traditional shells in some ways.<p>You have unlimited access to customize your editing experience. Everything the editor does can be changed because you have the same access to the interpreter & libs as the editor itself. Every key can be bound to a function, and the normal alphanum chars and such are bound to insert themselves by default, but you can change that. So if you want { to insert the closing } automatically, you can do that without much trouble. You can write it, evaluate the code, and then use it instantly without restarting your editor.<p>Personally I just use it for coding, but for me coding includes running zsh and a host of other REPLs. (ruby, python, javascript, ...) Some of the packages I have used approach or exceed IDE levels of integration with the project being worked on[2][3].<p>You can compile a C program or run grep and then step through errors/warnings or search results visiting each line and doing what you need to do. This is one way that Emacs one-ups the shell which prints static text as output. Emacs wraps that in an interactive interface, which is great in a lot of situations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://rubyforge.org/projects/emacs-rails/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubyforge.org/projects/emacs-rails/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://github.com/samsonjs/mojo.el"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/samsonjs/mojo.el</a><p>edit: One really cool thing I forgot to mention: js2-mode. Steve Yegge wrote a JavaScript parser in Emacs lisp which means that when editing JavaScript - which I do a lot of these days - the syntax highlighter has an immense amount of information to work with. Global vars are coloured differently from local vars (very important in JS as undeclared vars are implicitly global, ugh). Syntax errors get underlined in red instantly. If you've experienced this in other IDEs you appreciate how awesome this is. You never  run your code only to find that you made a stupid syntax error that needs fixing. Someone could use js2-mode to write advanced IDE-like functionality for JS, such as renaming & refactoring.<p>Anyone could implement something similar for any other language, if they have the time & will.",1273351480

1330877,comment,1330718,1330718,0,0,timr,,,"Pfft...10 days is amateur hour.  I just came back from a trip to France where I did nearly a month out of a single carry-on.  Part of the strategy is to depend on the amenities of the country you're visiting:  most places have laundromats, and so you can get away with carrying a week's worth of socks, underwear and shirts, knowing that you'll be doing laundry every week.  Same with stuff like soap, towels, shampoo, etc.  You can (usually) find it there.<p>The heaviest things to pack are shoes, pants, sweaters and coats.  Buy the right shoes, and you'll get by with one pair.  Likewise for pants:  you only really need two pairs, and if you're really intent on traveling light, you can find exceptionally lightweight nylon pants that look dressy enough for most situations, and that don't wrinkle.  Sweaters and coats are a little tougher, but if you count your body as a piece of baggage, you can minimize the burden:  for this trip, I carried two sweaters and a hoodie, and was pretty much always wearing one of the three items.  The other two were in the bag.<p>The other important thing to do is to make sure that everything coordinates in all possible combinations.  The easiest way to do this is to buy everything in shades of black or gray, but you can be more creative, just so long as your pants, shoes, shirts and sweaters are interchangeable.  Master this, and you can go for a surprisingly long time off of five days worth of clothing.<p>For this trip, I had two pairs of pants, five shirts, five changes of underwear and socks, two sweaters, a hoodie, a tiny laptop computer (EeePC's are awesome for travel), my iPod, two books, an extra pair of shoes (I have bad feet), a travel towel, and the usual cohort of tiny shampoo, soap, deodorant, etc.  Everything fit into an REI travel backpack that will fit into the smallest overhead bin.<p>The only other really critical tip that isn't totally obvious is that you <i>must</i> carry a zippable bag for your used clothing, or you'll smell like feet after a few days.  You can pick up hand-compressable space-bags at REI for $10.  They're awesome -- unzip, stuff your laundry in the bag, rezip, compress, and you're ready to go.  Thanks to the compression, I actually had <i>more</i> space in my bag at the end of each week.",1273350868

Its a common choice among Engineers to take up MBA after there Graduation (BE/BS/B Tech).<p>It kind of annoys me though.

1330873,comment,1329119,1329598,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I used to curate a small social site whose topic was somewhat sensitive.  IP address exposure became a significant concern with the population.  An earlier administration had left it on.  Particularly as the site grew and became less ""cozy"", and as the user base become more informed on the topic of IP addresses, users including old-timers used to the extant exposure became worried.  When control started to be passed off to me and a few others, we turned it off.<p>A significant fraction of the lack of concern in such situations is due to lack of knowledge and understanding.  Once users -- users in general, and not just the ""technophiles"" -- become aware of the situation and potential issues, a significant fraction DO have concerns are very explicitly DO NOT want the ""features""/exposure.<p>A specific example of the latter.  Our site was, aside from IP addressing, totally anonymous.  Pick a pseudonym, create an account, and you were in.  If you caused problems, you would be warned and, if you didn't get a clue, eventually banned.<p>There was, as there is in most populations, a subset of particularly manipulative users, some with what I guess might be described as ""borderline personality issues"".  One of these went on a kick, including possible multiple identities, causing me to dig in a bit.  The combination of IP address -- with attendant locality -- and a reference an unusual hobby -- meant that in under five minutes, I could have driven up to her doorstep.  (And, BTW, that would have been in a rural location where help is not a few minutes away.)<p>Of course, I didn't use the information that way, but it was useful in reminding her, in a suitably oblique and non-threatening but pointed enough message, that her shenanigans were a bit more transparent than she might have thought.<p>The premise that ""privacy is dead"" and that there is no real value for users in maintaining it, is completely fallacious.  I've personally witnessed, very often, very significant, meaningful exchanges occur in the context of and precisely because of such privacy and anonymity.  There are sensitive issues that you may NOT share in common with your neighbors, family, friends.  Even when some of those people are supportive, they may not share the actual experience, nor be sources of useful information and counseling on how to address it.  And not infrequently, those people are actually the source of problems.  And they often know each other, so that if you speak with one, it influences other relationships.<p>People on the community I curated did expose their real identities to each other.  But it was usually in private -- out of band -- via email, IM, and the like.  And it was after getting to know one another within the context of the community and coming to trust each other enough to do so.<p>If a stranger walks up to you and asks you for your phone number, it's unlikely you will provide it -- not solely on that basis.  Online social networks need similar contexts.  You exchange personally identifiable information if and only if it suits you and AFTER you've established some trust.<p>ADDENDUM:  Facebook, per its terms of service, does insist on a real name.  Depending on one's name, that is more or less unique.  But it doesn't (so far, at least) insist on your location (or maybe I've forgotten this, having entered a very ""vague"" big city name, myself) nor necessarily expose it as text.  They turned off privacy for profile pictures, but as of this point at least, you don't have to provide one or a picture that is of you.<p>Their message facility implies privacy.  It's a principal means for communicating with another user who is not a friend.  Exposing IP addresses can provide fairly specific locality.  (Comcast DNS entries are one example I can think of that narrow things down considerably.)  The stalker potential is not inconsiderable.  (And, to bring the topic of forced public profile pictures up again, combine this with a pretty picture, and you may have one source for a potential problem.)<p>In the past, social communities have served specifically as a layer of abstraction between users and IP addressing.  Administrators had access to addresses, and so one needed to establish trust for a site.  But other users did not.  Kind of like going to a party.  The host may have invited you, and you might wear a name tag, but you don't write your address on the tag.<p>Have you ever gone to a party or meeting where they surprise you with an attendee address list to be shared publicly?  Feel a bit queasy when you learn of this?  Start trusting the host less?  Just write down your name, or name and a suitably large city name that you live in or near?<p>Actually, I recall something like that, a few years ago, having both U.S. citizens and Canadians.  The U.S. citizens coughed up their full addresses and phone numbers.  The Canadians almost all kept it to ""Vancouver, BC"" or similar, and if they provided any specific means of contact, it was an email address -- mostly of the gmail or hotmail variety.",1273350785

1330819,story,,,7,9,fizx,"Ask HN: Should I build this?",,"I want to build a service called ""Treefort"", ""Speakeasy"", ""Fight Club"", or perhaps ""Clique"".  It would be a social network with emphasis on group communication and privacy.<p>Sweet spots for the service include teenagers with nosy parents, gay people who want to show different sides of their personality to different groups, and people who just don't like the public-default models of the current social networks.<p>While the basic features would be the standard status updates and photos, I think there are some interesting points of differentiation:<p>1) No one knows whether you have an account.  There is no people search.  If I want to be friends with ""Joe User"", I type it in, and get the response ""If Joe is using Speakeasy, and wants to be friends, we'll let you know.""<p>2) Groups/friendlists/gangs are 1st-class citizens.  When you accept a friend request, you put the user in a group.  When you send a status update, you send it to a group.<p>3) Group management is made easy via good ui, intelligent defaults, and machine learning.  The dropdown box to select the group receiving your status update defaults to your most recently messaged group.  The dropdown box that asks you which group to put a new friend in defaults to the group with the most social-graph overlap with the new user.  You may occasionally receive intelligent suggestions to add a user to a group.  Imagine that you are using Speakeasy to share class notes in college, and one of your friends is taking the class, but isn't in your group.  If enough other people in your group added him, then you might receive the suggestion that you should allow him in.<p>This service would be in many ways more email-like than social-network.  It's something I wish existed.  I'm not entirely sure how much money there is in this, but I think the overhead of running it would be relatively low.<p>Thoughts?",1273349184
